October 3rd - October 12th, 2024
Navratri literally means nine (nav) nights (ratri). It is celebrated in honor of the Divine Mother of the Universe in Her various forms. Out of Her causeless compassion, the Divine Mother takes on many forms that represent her varied moods to grace souls in a multitude of ways. Navratri is a time when all of Her divine forms are celebrated with devotion and exuberance! As an offering to Her lotus feet, this Navratri, the Radha Krishna Temple of Dallas (Allen) reverentially presents a rainbow of activities for the entire Dallas community!
Join us to participate in Garba, poojas, Durgashtami Havan, and so much more!

The early morning of Thursday - 1 August 2024, was a day Nigerians actualized their planned protest termed “End Bad Governance Protest” against the governance of the nation. The heat of the protest was growing in the northern part of Nigeria where some Polish students were arrested allegedly for waving the Russian flag. However, it was not reported by any Kano based civic journalist. According to the diplomatic statement from the Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs, he stated that “the students were only at the wrong place at the wrong time”. They were later released.

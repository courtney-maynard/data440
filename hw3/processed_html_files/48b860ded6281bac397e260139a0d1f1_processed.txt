Learn How To Create Thought-Provoking Visuals (even if you have zero design experience):
Learn the exact framework I use to create powerful visual posts on social media that helped me attract over 1 million followers in 7 months.
I grew my brand @visualhustles on Instagram from 0 - 1.4 million followers which helped me make a living online all without having to show my face on my brand.
I started my page @visualhustles on Instagram back in April 2023 and since then, have been able to grow this page to over 1 million followers in 7 months (You can confirm this from my profile through the growth highlights)
So, how was I able to do this?
The key lies in one minimalistic style of content that anyone can learn:
Simple, yet captivating visual designs.
Some of the many minimalistic, yet viral visual designs I‚Äôve posted on my page: @visualhustles.
After posting over 2000+ of these insightful visuals on my page, I often get asked many questions from people:
"How are you creating these visuals?"
"How can I design and learn how to create these visuals even with my time being limited with other duties?"
‚ÄúHow can I go out and inspire others through visual lessons?‚Äù
That's why I've created this complete video course to help guide you step by step‚Ä¶
On how you too can start creating these quick, simple, and inspirational visuals for your social media platforms (Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.)...
And grow it to new heights with or without showing your face online.
Before I tell you more about the course, I want to share with you why visual content is a cheat-code to building a strong and successful presence on social media:
Faster Consumption of Information
With decreasing attention spans (down to around 8 seconds), people are more inclined to engage with visual content because it‚Äôs quicker to consume.
Visuals deliver complex information in a digestible way, which is key in today‚Äôs fast-paced digital environment.
It‚Äôs much easier to process and understand the visual, right?
Better Information Retention
People remember 65% of visual content they‚Äôve seen even three days later, compared to only 10% for text-based content. (Dr. John Medina, Brain Rules)
The human brain processes visuals 60,000 times faster than text. (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)
This makes visuals
More effective in grabbing attention and delivering messages quickly.
Extremely attractive for an average social-media user like you and I.
Insights from one of my many viral visual posts from my page @visualhustles on Instagram.
Boosted Reach and Shares
Social media posts with visuals are 40 times more likely to be shared compared to text-only content.
Infographics, specifically, are shared and liked three times more than other types of content on social media platforms.

Adaptation to Algorithms
Social media algorithms, like those on Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn favor content that generates high engagement‚Äîvisual posts lead to higher engagement, which means your content is more likely to be prioritized in user feeds.
Past 90 days Insights from my Instagram page @visualhustles
As you can see, in a world where attention spans are shrinking and competition for visibility is fierce, visuals are a must-have for your social media success.
They not only capture attention quicker but also lead to significantly higher engagement, shares, and retention!

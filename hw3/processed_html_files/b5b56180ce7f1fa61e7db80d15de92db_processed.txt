10 Pet-Friendly Trails in the Shawnee National Forest
Are you looking for pet-friendly trails in the Shawnee National Forest?
Do you love to hike with your dog? Or maybe even your cat? But you’re unsure what trails in the Shawnee National Forest are appropriate for hiking with pets? I get these questions all the time. I usually answer them outright.
However, I think an article dedicated to some of the better pet-friendly trails in the Shawnee National Forest is long overdue.
I hope you find this article helpful for taking your furry friends out on the hiking trails in the Shawnee National Forest.
Not So Pet-Friendly Trails in the Shawnee National Forest
Horse trails.
To be blunt, horse trails are going to be the biggest, least pet-friendly trails in the Shawnee National Forest.
This is for a few reasons:
(1) Some horses may not be used to your pets. Your pets might spook them, and the horse could even hurt your pet in the process of being spooked.
(2) Some horse riders bring dogs with them. Typically, they’re not on a leash (which is against the rules ), and that could cause concern if their dog has a negative interaction with your pet.
(3) Horse trails are typically rugged, and many are damaged from extensive equestrian use. They won’t be the most comfortable trails for your pets.
My recommendation is to steer clear of horse trails when hiking with your pets.
There are many pet-friendly trails in the Shawnee National Forest to choose from, so don’t worry; you and your furry friends are not missing out on anything.
Pet-Friendly Trails in the Shawnee National Forest
Here are 10 of the most pet friendly trails in the Shawnee National Forest to start enjoying today.
​1 – Little Grand Canyon (Rugged)
The Little Grand Canyon in southern Illinois is a picturesque natural landmark featuring steep sandstone bluffs, lush forests, and scenic hiking trails that offer breathtaking views of the Mississippi River floodplain.
This trail is a true loop hike. It is approximately 3.5 miles long and has a total elevation of around 450 feet if hiked clockwise. It is rugged.
This trail is rugged and should only be hiked with experienced pets. You have to hike down a waterfall cascade and hike back up another. When it’s wet, it’s slick. There are venomous snakes and more biting insects here than usual. The canyon is known to flood during wet seasons as it sits right next to the Big Muddy River.
If the area is wet, small pools of water form, which your pet could drink from. If the area is dry, there will not be many water sources aside from the river, which could be difficult to get to.
2 – Pomona Natural Bridge (Easy)
The Pomona Natural Bridge in southern Illinois is a stunning natural rock formation that spans 90 feet. Serene forests surround it and offer a scenic hiking experience.
Pomona Natural Bridge is a lollipop loop trail that is approximately half a mile long and 100 feet in elevation. It is very easy to hike with pets.
The arch sits high above the ground, and there are definitely fall hazards. The rocks could become slick when wet, and venomous snakes are present in this area.
When the area is wet, natural water puddles and pools will form around the waterfall and creek areas. Otherwise, during dry weather, no water sources will be available.
3 – Quetil Trail (Easy)
The Quetil Trail in Alto Pass , Illinois, is a scenic pathway that winds through lush forests. It offers hikers beautiful views of the surrounding natural landscapes and the unique bluffs of the region.
Quetil Trail is approximately 2.5 miles long. It is an out-and-back trail with low elevation and few hills, making it easy to hike with pets.
Venomous snakes occur in this area. At some point, there is private property. Please don’t hike past private property signs, gates, or purple paint.
There may be water fountains in the park across the road from the trailhead. Otherwise, you should bring your own water for your pet.
4 – Indian Creek Trail (Moderate)
Indian Creek Trail at Giant City State Park is a scenic trail featuring a very beautiful creek and bluffs that ancient Native American people once used.
Indian Creek is a lollipop loop. The trail is less than one mile long and under 50 feet high. It is a moderate hike due to some rocky surfaces and creek crossings.
If there has been a lot of rain, the area is subject to flash flooding. Even with bridges over the creek, it could be impassable. Venomous snakes occur in this area.
Typically, there is water in the creek in case your pet needs a drink.
5 – Blackjack Oak Trail (Moderate)
Blackjack Oak Trail at Ferne Clyffe State Park is a great trail to take your pet. It features amazing overlooks and bluffs.
The trail is 3 miles out and back, and the elevation is around 330 feet. This is a moderate hike for you and your pet.
Dangerous areas exist along this trail. There are high points where falling can be deadly. Please use caution around the edges. There are some steeper rock scrambles that you have to hike down. Venomous snakes occur in this area.
Water is typically not available along this trail. Please pack plenty of water for you and your pet.
6 – Heron Pond Trail (Moderate)
Heron Pond is an Illinois Nature Preserve that features swamps, sloughs, beautiful views of the Cache River, and an abundance of wildlife.
This 2.2-mile trail is mainly out-and-back, with a small loop included. The total elevation is around 100 feet. It is a moderate trail for those hiking with pets.
This area typically sees more venomous snakes than most, as it is a swamp. Biting insects can also be an issue here. During wetter seasons, the area is prone to flooding. Please use caution around the edge of the banks to not fall into the river.
It is not advisable to allow a pet to drink from the water in this area. Swamps are often susceptible to blue-green algae spreads, which can be harmful to pets.
7 – Tunnel Hill State Trail (Easy)
Tunnel Hill State Trail is a 45-mile rail trail featuring many trailheads to start from, allowing you to choose your mileage.
The trail is 45+ miles in length. You can choose your own mileage. Most people hike from Vienna towards the Tunnel. You could also start from Tunnel Hill and head towards Vienna. This is a good place to bike with pets, too. The elevation is very easy, as it’s an old railroad bed. This is an easy trail for pet owners.
Venomous snakes occur in this area. This is a bicycle and pedestrian trail, so people may ride bikes. Some people ride eBikes, which can go pretty fast on the trail.
Each trailhead has a water spigot, but you should bring your own water as the spigots are usually about 10 miles apart.
8 – Lake Trail at Lake Glendale (Easy)
The Lake Glendale Trail is a nice trail that circles the entire lake and is easily accessible from the campground.
This trail is about 3 miles long, a true loop trail, and under 100 feet in elevation. It is very easy for pet owners.
Venomous snakes occur in this area. Be careful around the lake, as you or your pet could fall in if you get too close. For the most part, the trail is a safe enough distance from the lake. This trail is also designated for mountain biking, and while riders are supposed to yield to hikers, sometimes they don’t.
I recommend bringing your own water on this hike. I’ve seen signs of Blue Green Algae in the water, which can be harmful to your pets.
9 – Rim Rock National Recreation Trail (Moderate)
Rim Rock National Recreation Trail is a nice trail system that leads to a beach. However, pets are not allowed on the beach.
Rim Rock has a trail system that is 2.5 to 3 miles long. At this point, the trails are out and back until the stairs are fixed. There is a nice top loop, but the trails on the bottom are out and back. The total elevation is around 330 feet, and there are some hilly conditions.
Venomous snakes occur in this area. There are dangerous bluffs in the area where fall hazards are present. Please use caution while on this trail.
This area doesn’t typically have much water aside from the creeks. You’re better off bringing plenty of water for yourself and your pet.
10 – High Knob Hiker Only Trail (Rugged)
High Knob is a rugged trail with very scenic bluffs, slot cave-like passageways, rolling hills, and interesting rock formations.
The High Knob trail is around a mile in length. There are some rock scrambles and technical areas that make this trail rugged. The trail is supposed to be for hikers only, but horse riders do occasionally use the trail (though they are prohibited from doing so).
Venomous snakes occur in this area. There are also some areas where fall hazards are present. Please use caution around the edges of bluffs and along the rock scrambles that you take to get down to the trail.
Water is unavailable along this trail.
Hiking with Pets Etiquette
The pet-friendly trails in the Shawnee National Forest can be delightful for both you and your pet, but there are some unofficial guidelines that you should follow to ensure everyone can enjoy the trails as you do.
First and foremost, always keep your pet on a leash. This helps protect wildlife, other hikers, and your pet from potential dangers. All trails in the Shawnee have leash laws, and adhering to them is crucial for maintaining harmony on the trails.
Additionally, always clean up after your pet. Bring along waste bags and dispose of them properly. Leaving pet waste on the trail is not only unsightly but can also harm the environment and spread diseases to wildlife. By cleaning up after your pet, you contribute to preserving the natural beauty of the Shawnee National Forest for everyone to enjoy.
It’s also important to be mindful of other hikers. Not everyone is comfortable around dogs, and some people may have allergies or a fear of animals. Keep your pet close to you and avoid letting them approach strangers without permission. If you encounter other hikers with pets, allow them to pass by, maintaining a safe distance to prevent any potential conflicts between animals.
Lastly, ensure your pet is well-prepared for the hike. Bring enough water for both you and your pet, and take frequent breaks to rest and hydrate. The trails in the Shawnee can be rugged and challenging, so make sure your pet is physically capable of handling the terrain.
By following these etiquette guidelines, you can help create a positive experience for all hikers and protect the Shawnee National Forest’s natural beauty.

Great article. I have had my dogs on many of those trails. I’ve also ridden my horse for many years in southern Illinois and know what it’s like meeting loose dogs that have ran up behind my horses and spooked them. Thank you for warning people to try to keep people and animals safe.

Build a better world onchain, starting with your local community.
WHAT IS BASED AFRICA?
Base is for everyone who wants to build a better internet, and we’re calling all builders in Africa to solve real challenges in your community by building onchain. From instant payments, access to financial services, and getting rewarded for creativity, going onchain is improving the lives of people around the world — but that's just the beginning. We’re looking to you to start building a better future onchain, starting right where you are. See a problem in your community? Solve it. Have an idea? Build it. Every app you create brings us closer to an onchain world where everyone thrives. Based Africa is part of the Based Around the World regional Buildathon series in Africa , India , Southeast Asia , and LatAm . These regions have unstoppable builder energy. We can’t wait to see your creativity, onchain.
THE PROMPT
Build an onchain app that solves a challenge in your community OR Use existing onchain tools to create real-world impact in your community by bringing them onchain. If you’re looking for ideas, here are a few places to start:
Help people come together, connect, and collaborate more easily — onchain or IRL
Unlock access to social and educational resources
Build tools that provide easier access to the onchain economy
Create localized social or e-commerce apps
Create platforms that empower creators to share their work (or, if you're a creator yourself, share your own)
Make a blog, write a blog post, create a YouTube or TikTok video, or other content showing how you're making an impact and bringing your community onchain

Rewards: 3.125 to 12.5 ETH from Base and $BUILD from Talent Protocol.
Marketing & Distribution: All winners will be highlighted at a Base meetup event in-region with Jesse Pollak, and featured on Base social channels (X, Warpcast).

Must submit one project per team
Must include a functioning onchain app at a publicly accessible URL
Must include an open-source GitHub repository for all source code in the app

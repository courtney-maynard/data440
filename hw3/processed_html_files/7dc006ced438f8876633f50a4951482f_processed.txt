Speaker TBD
New York is on a path to achieving zero-emission electricity, renewable energy generation and economy-wide carbon neutrality.  What are we doing to make NY's buildings and infrastructure more energy efficient? How are reducing waste and emissions? How are we creating and storing renewable energy? What are the latest developments, in nuclear, offshore wind, electric, thermal and all alternative energy sources? We discuss all the above, alongside the newest solutions and programs that are here and on the horizon.

Sandy Nurse
NYC Council Member District 37
What are the impacts to NY's small businesses, and to the average customer?  How do we make sure no one is left behind, how can cost impacts be mitigated, and how will policy decisions affect affordable housing?   What jobs need to be set up that make sense with national incentives to effectively support a workforce prepared to meet project development and generation facility needs? What are the workforce training and apprenticeship programs that are needed for a fair transition for both workers, all communities and those displaced by the clean energy transition? How does the energy industry help promote economic development and facilitate investments in energy efficiency?

Kendra Hems
President TANY/Trucking Association of NY
The future of New York depends on reducing emissions and adapting to the obvious threat of climate change. New York has established plans to implement new infrastructures, housing mobility, and land acquisition options. We have been launching programs to explore new resources, including making solar-generated electricity both accessible and affordable.  Our government has been collaborating with public, private, and community partners to center equity in the transition away from fossil fuels through alternative energy sources and storage policies and programs.  What is working, what is coming up, and what are new ideas in this area?

Andrew Buck
Vice President The Parkside Group
Climate smart communities aim to operate as efficiently as possible. By using alternative and efficient energy, New York can help make their communities greener, livable, equitable, and resilient to the effects of climate change. We have already taken steps to use renewable energy to power our work, homes, schools, and public facilities. We are also working on the decarbonization of freight citywide and the electrification of New York’s vehicles. During this panel we will discuss ideas to build resilient cities and communities designed to anticipate and respond to emergencies, and issues.

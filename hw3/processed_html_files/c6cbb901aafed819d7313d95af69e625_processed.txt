Reading sacred scriptures and texts with a ‚Äúgreen lens‚Äù
Emphasizing connection and community
Building and growing community partnerships, including with farms and local businesses
Working against environmental injustice
Telling hope-filled climate stories.
This type of ministry addresses issues like protection of the land and water, increased food prices, threats to vulnerable people, climate-induced migration, and psychological crises related to climate stress. By integrating climate awareness regularly into sermons and classes, offering counseling and other opportunities to process climate anxiety, and creating community-focused initiatives, climate-informed ministries aim to build resilience and meet the evolving needs of their communities amidst rapidly changing environmental conditions.
At this special ‚ÄúFaith Field Day,‚Äù you‚Äôll have an opportunity to begin your exploration of Climate-informed Ministry and consider how it‚Äôs important for your own context. The time will include:
6 actionable presentations on topics such as dealing with eco-anxiety, environmental ethics, environmental justice issues in Iowa, and what resilience can look like for a congregation like yours.
A Q&A session with the panelists
An opportunity to tour the building and grounds of the ‚Äúgreenest church in Iowa.‚Äù It‚Äôs an amazing space, and you‚Äôll definitely be inspired to think anew about your own location, building, and opportunities!
Separate interactive, exploratory activities for children are available.

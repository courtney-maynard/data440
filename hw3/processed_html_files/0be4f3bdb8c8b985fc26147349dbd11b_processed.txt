BlockDAG Shocks the Market With $1 Million Giveaway as Presale Explodes—Ethereum ETFs Drop as Fantom Surges
In cryptocurrency market, Ethereum ETFs experienced a significant drop on Monday, with a staggering $79 million moving out. This shift highlights a growing trend where enthusiasm is cooling off due to Ethereum’s recent slow pace in rolling out new developments.
On the flip side, Fantom (FTM) is buzzing with a nearly 90% surge in value since the debut of its Sonic testnet. Now, it’s at a crucial juncture, grappling with a key resistance level that could either catapult its price to $1 or see it struggle to maintain the momentum.
Meanwhile, BlockDAG is making waves with its whopping $84.2 million presale, fueled further by a tantalizing $1M giveaway. With analysts whispering about a potential 20,000x return, the big question is: will this surge in presale activity lead to an explosive increase in price sooner than many might expect?

Brad Gregory is organizing this fundraiser.
Donation protected
Hi, My name is Brad Gregory and as many of you have heard our dear friend Bob Bowman was severely injured while on a hike near his beloved home in West Yellowstone, Montana. Bob will be hospitalized for an undetermined length of time and will not be able to travel or perform music for several months at the least. Bob does have Medicare and we all hope that most of his medical costs will be covered but he will have no source of income for the foreseeable future. He was scheduled to come to the Kansas City area this week and had a very full itinerary of music gigs.  We are asking for your generous donation in order to help Bob and Yae with their non medical expenses for these critical months ahead. All donations will go right to them.

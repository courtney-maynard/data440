Navigating Hybrid and Multi-cloud Complexity: A Smarter Path to Secure Application Delivery
As enterprises increasingly move towards a mix of on-premises, private, and public cloud infrastructures, maintaining consistency across billing models, configurations, and UIs, not to mention security and performance, becomes a significant concern. And it’s not just the fact of hybridization: the ideal combination of cloud infrastructures must be tailored to specific organizational needs and goals—there is no one-size-fits-all.
In this Tech Talk, industry expert, Andrew Gibson, speaks to veteran technology journalist John K. Waters about the challenges of providing application access across hybrid/multi-cloud environments and how this can be efficiently streamlined, regardless of the traffic layer or platform. Learn how organizations can break down silos, providing a path to a unified and simplified hybrid cloud environment that supports growth and security.

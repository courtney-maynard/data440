In Clinic + Mobile Vet + Telehealth
SPEAK TO A TELEHEALTH VET
Available during after hours
What We Do
We’re bringing a new flare to the veterinary industry. We’re borrowing concepts from thought leaders and industry disruptors to make things a little more convenient, a little less of a headache and a lot more pro-pets.
We’re the first in Las Vegas to combine telehealth, mobile veterinary care and in-clinic under one metaphorical roof to exponentially improve access to care. And we’re making pricing transparent so you know what you get before you ever step in the door.
Highlands Animal Care
Our first physical location is open and is located near Dragon Ridge Country Club with two easy access points to I-215. With a fear-free design concept and all the latest in veterinary technology, you and your pet family will have access to quality, convenient care.
Monday – Friday, we are 8am-6pm
Saturday – Sunday, 9am-3pm
Telehealth
When you can’t wait for an in-person appointment, connect with a Live Veterinarian 24/7/365.
We’re paving the way in Las Vegas to improve much-needed access to care. Every Emergency Telehealth appointment comes with an in-person follow-up appointment.
If and when an appointment requires an emergency room visit, the Emergency Triage team will help facilitate.
Did you know – many veterinary services can be performed in the comfort of your own home?

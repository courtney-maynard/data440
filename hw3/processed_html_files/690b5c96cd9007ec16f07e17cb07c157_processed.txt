Today, we expect unified, personalized customer experiences wherever we choose to engage with brands. Too often, though, disjointed processes, siloed teams and unreliable access to key data make that an insurmountable  challenge. As challenges go, this one’s a beast, but one we can tame together.
Join Airship and The Drum for a special LinkedIn Live panel discussion hosted at The Drum Labs in Shoreditch, London —  ‘From fragmented to fluid: how to improve mobile-first customer experience for 2025’ on Tuesday, October 8 at 4:30pm GMT/11:30am EDT/8:30am PDT.  The Drum’s associate editor, Richard Draycott, will be joined by Airship’s chief strategy and marketing officer Tom Butta, Nithin Ramachandra, head of new services, Vodafone, and Sienne Veit, founder & chief product officer of Invisible Stuff (formerly CPO at Kingfisher).
You’ll learn how:
- Optimizing mobile-first customer experiences unlocks digital success
- Overcoming a reliance on developers helps eliminate silos across teams, channels and data
- Delivering true customer-centric experiences boosts loyalty and retention.

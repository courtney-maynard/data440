Introduction
Imagine having a strategy that could help you identify potential reversals in the market while also confirming the overall trend direction. Combining the Relative Strength Index (RSI) with an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) offers a powerful method to do just that. In this article, we’ll explore how these two indicators can work together to create a robust trading strategy. We’ll also dive into the details of each indicator and how they can be implemented in Python to backtest their effectiveness on various assets.
What is RSI?
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It ranges from 0 to 100 and is typically used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in a market.
Overbought: When the RSI is above 70, it suggests that the asset may be overbought and could be due for a pullback.
Oversold: When the RSI is below 30, it indicates that the asset might be oversold and could be due for a rebound.

Video from Pole Creek Baptist Church in North Carolina, showing the delivery of our Health Ranger Store food buckets to a relief field where people are able to drop by and collect food and other supplies. This is another part of our effort to help Americans in need while FEMA ABANDONS AMERICA (and blames the victims, too). That's okay, we don't need FEMA. Slash FEMA's budget by 100%. America's churches and entrepreneurs will do the job instead. https://www.brighteon.com/48143661-5bdf-44b7-b96a-95388ec9b13b

Today's WaPo piece claiming militia groups are "hunting" FEMA is complete B.S. FEMA actively interfered with the delivery of critical aid to Americans, intentionally trying to increase fatalities, starvation and human suffering. When regular Americans stepped up to do the job of helping people in need, while wearing sidearms to protect supplies from looters, FEMA whips up a victimization story claiming they're being "hunted," and the CIA-controlled WaPo rolls it out to blame North Carolina residents for FEMA's failures. Like I said, your government is at WAR with you, and now FEMA's P.R. spin is all part of the info war.

Good morning Divine Ones and happy Self-Love Sunday. What is your most loving choice today?
I’m taking it slow this morning and enjoying the peace and quiet. I can hear my wind chimes singing their special songs in the background, the gentle hum of the refrigerator and an occasional bird’s song as well. My essential oil diffuser is sharing the aroma of Evergreen Essence, a grounding blend of conifer trees that smells like being in the forest.
Today I’m putting together the last minute changes for the monthly free Ho’oponopono webinar. This month we will be talking about “Cultivating Peace with Ho’oponopono” in honor of International Nonviolence Day and the birthday of Mahatma Gandhi. If there ever was a time that we needed support in creating peace in our world, it is now!
It’s important that we realize that in order for us to experience peace in our world, the place to begin this process is within ourselves. Patterns of aggressiveness and behaviors that create conflict are innate to the Human experience. And I remember a wonderful teacher sharing that as long as there is one person on the planet that is holding the energy of conflict and war within themselves there is the potential of conflict and war resurfacing in our world.
Ho’oponopono as the ancient Hawaiian problem solving process is the perfect tool for healing this human dynamic. The reason it’s the ideal tool to address this is because all we’re doing is initiating the process. And by doing so, we are in essence asking Divinity to transmute all the energy in the form of memories replaying from our own Subconscious Mind that are the root cause for the problem. So when we say “I love you, I’m sorry, Please forgive me, Thank you” or “I love you” or “Thank you” repeatedly, we are saying to Divinity that we accept 100% responsibility for the problem and turn it over to Divinity to transmute the energy from us first.  The process then continues with Divinity transmuting this from everyone holding it in their energy field. But the process doesn’t stop there. Divinity continues to transmute this energy through our ancestral lineages back to the beginning of Creation. That is how powerful this simple process is.
Let us as a Community of Human Beings focus our Ho’oponopono cleaning on the issues of conflict, fear and war to support the manifestation of Peace within each of us and in our relationships with each other. And may we pray that Peace prevails in our lifetime.
I wish you all a peace-filled day knowing you are loved dearly. And you are invited to remember to consistently ask yourself the question “What is my most loving choice?” and choose whatever it is that you feel inspired to do.
Here’s a Ho’oponopono cleaning statement you might consider repeating several times a day by thinking these words or writing them or speaking them into the Universe:
To whatever memories are in me that are the seed thought and cause for the experience of conflict, fear and war, through our shared ancestral lineages, on any and all levels, that I am to atone for, I blanket each of us and all of us with the Fleur-de-Lis and say I love you, I’m sorry, Please forgive me, Thank you. 💗⚜️🌈🫐🍓💦🌎🦋

Fall 2024 | Ottawa |  Toronto | Winnipeg | Vancouver | Calgary | The Canadian Chamber of Commerce is hitting the road for its five-city Natural Resources Tour!
This fall, in partnership with chambers of commerce and boards of trade, the Canadian Chamber is crossing the country for a five-city national speaking tour alongside experts from leading Canadian organizations in the natural resources sector.
Canada’s natural resources sector is an essential contributor to Canada’s economy, supplying jobs and ensuring energy security and affordability. With the right policy framework in place, this sector has the potential to not only meet Canada’s needs but also provide for the growing global demand for food, fuel, fertilizer and critical minerals.
Discussions will focus on:
The sector’s impact on Canada’s economy and global standing.
The role of natural resources in supporting Indigenous participation and reconciliation.
Challenges and opportunities in leveraging Canada’s abundant natural resources while maintaining global competitiveness.
The influence of policy on economic growth and affordability for all Canadians.

AI generated image circulating social media.
In the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, Asheville, North Carolina and other impacted regions were flooded with water, while fake generative AI images of destruction and human suffering flooded social media.
These doctored or faked visuals can complicate disaster response efforts, create false narratives and, above all, harm public trust in a moment when normal people are making extraordinary efforts to help one another in the midst of life and death scenarios.
In particular, two images of a distressed child holding a puppy and who appears to be trapped in floodwaters has gained traction online.
As an expert in video and photo forensics, I can say with certainty that these emotionally evocative images are highly edited or outright fake. The first image (above) bears telltale signs of a deepfake to a trained eye. Comparing it with the second image in the series (below) — in which the young girl has one too many fingers — the puppy’s muzzle has a different coloration and the boat is a different shape and color.
Notice the hand holding the puppy has an extra finger in this AI-generated image.

The Problem with Fake Images During Disasters
Repeated exposure to fake content can erode public trust in legitimate news and information sources. When people repeatedly encounter false images, they begin to question all media, including accurate and necessary disaster updates.

The Psychological Toll of Fake Images
The repeated exposure to fake content during disasters creates an emotional whiplash. People experience initial shock or sadness when they see images of devastation or distress, but when those images are debunked, it leads to feelings of betrayal, confusion or anger. This cycle can quickly wear down our ability to engage emotionally with real crises.
The Exhaustion of Verification
In the past, people could see an image of a disaster and instantly react, whether by donating, sharing it or sympathizing with those affected. Today, with so much misinformation floating around, even this simple act of caring comes with the extra step of verification.
Before reacting, people now need to check if the image is real, where it comes from and whether it’s been manipulated. This constant mental effort adds a layer of fatigue, and many simply disengage, feeling it’s easier to not care than to wade through the sea of misinformation.
The Desensitization Effect
Every time a person learns that an image they were emotionally invested in is fake, it chips away at their compassion. People don’t like feeling duped, and once they’ve been misled a few times, they can begin to doubt everything they see.
This skepticism makes it harder to summon genuine care during real disasters, as the fear of being fooled again overshadows the desire to help. Over time, they begin to tune out, treating every new disaster with a degree of emotional distance, unsure if it’s real or just another hoax.
Too Much Effort to Believe
Belief, particularly in times of crisis, should be simple. We should be able to see images and news reports of disasters and trust that they are accurate representations of what’s happening.
However, the proliferation of fake images during events like Hurricane Helene has made this once-simple process far more complicated. A handful of bad actors can have an oversized impact by creating and sharing deepfakes that go viral.
Fake Images Hurt Real People
It now takes effort to decide whether to trust or engage with content. This effort can create problematic reactions that are detrimental to the individual and the collective.
Apathy as a Defense Mechanism
When people feel they can no longer trust what they see, they may stop trying altogether. It’s easier to not care than to expend the mental energy required to verify every image or story.
This lack of engagement ultimately harms genuine disaster-relief efforts, as fewer people could step forward to help or donate.
Overwhelming Uncertainty
For some, the constant uncertainty about what’s real and what’s fake becomes too much to handle. Instead of carefully navigating between real and fake images, they may choose to disengage from disaster news entirely.
This detachment not only affects how individuals respond to disasters but also weakens the overall collective response. When entire segments of the population stop paying attention because they can’t trust what they see, it becomes harder to mobilize widespread support and resources.
Skepticism Toward All Media
Fake disaster images don’t just damage trust in the specific events they misrepresent, they erode trust in all media over time. People who feel deceived by one image are more likely to become skeptical of future disaster coverage, even if it’s legitimate.
In the long run, this makes it harder to share crucial, life-saving information during emergencies with expedience and accuracy.
Why This Numbness Matters in Future Disasters
The most troubling consequence of this growing apathy and numbness is its potential to severely impact future disaster responses. When people can no longer distinguish between fake and real crises, or when they’ve become too exhausted to try, it poses several dangers:
Fewer Donations and Volunteering Efforts
Humanitarian efforts often rely on a surge of compassion during crises. However, if people stop believing in disaster reports or grow numb to the images of suffering, they could be less likely to donate, volunteer or share crucial information. This decrease in public engagement can limit the effectiveness of relief efforts, leaving communities vulnerable for longer.
Increased Inaction During Real Emergencies
If people have been repeatedly exposed to fake disaster images, they might respond with a sense of “disaster fatigue” during actual emergencies. Instead of rallying together to help, they might question whether the crisis is as bad as it seems, resulting in slower action and fewer resources for those in need.
Fractured Social Unity
The rise of fake images tied to real disasters is not just a problem of misinformation. It is creating a deeper issue of emotional numbness and distrust. As people grow weary of trying to discern truth from falsehood, they could become less inclined to care, act or believe at all. This cynicism poses a serious risk to future disaster responses, as fewer people may step forward to help when it’s needed most.

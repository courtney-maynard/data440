Walk With Us
To Prevent Suicide
Join Us Today
The Community Walks, held in hundreds of cities across the country, are the core of the Out of the Darkness movement, which began in 2004. These events give people the courage to open up about their own connections to the cause, and a platform to create a culture that’s smarter about mental health. Friends, family members, neighbors and coworkers walk side-by-side, supporting each other and in memory of those we’ve lost.
Now, more than ever, it’s important to be there for one another and take steps to safeguard our mental health and prevent suicide.
Register today and be part of the movement to walk #OutOftheDarkness.

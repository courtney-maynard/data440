In the two decades since the completion of the first draft of the human genome, the landscape of biological research has undergone a revolutionary transformation. The field of genomics has expanded exponentially, giving rise to a broader "omics" revolution, encompassing diverse data types such as single-cell RNA sequencing, proteomics, and metabolomics to name a few.
These cutting-edge technologies are providing unprecedented insights into biological functions at the most granular level, offering a deeper understanding of disease mechanisms, organism adaptations, and interactions with environmental factors, including drugs and chemicals. The implications of this omics explosion are far-reaching, promising to revolutionize drug discovery , precision medicine , agriculture , and biomanufacturing .
However, the majority of life sciences organizations struggle to fully unlock these insights, due to a variety of challenges posed by the existing data infrastructure and technologies used. To overcome these challenges, modernizing data platforms is crucial for the successful application of multi-omics in research and development.
In this blog we explore how new technologies such as Databricks Data Intelligence Platform can address these issues, paving the way for more effective and efficient multi-omics data management.
Most organizations struggle to tap into this data due to legacy architecture
Legacy data infrastructures struggle to manage the complexities of multiomics data, particularly in providing a scalable solution for data integration and analyzing these massive datasets. Furthermore, they lack native support for advanced analytics and the rising demand for AI.
Issues such as data interoperability, accessibility, and reusability are common, exacerbated by the lack of standardization across siloed omics platforms. To make this even more complex, organizations must balance data accessibility with patient privacy and regulatory compliance in a highly regulated environment.
Key data challenges facing life sciences organizations
How are organizations currently addressing these issues? Today, most employ a range of technologies concurrently to handle omics data. This strategy, however, presents several challenges, including:
Data Volume and Complexity
Omics data is both vast and highly complex, requiring advanced computational methods for analysis. For example, with the rise of advanced deep learning methods for multi-omics data integration , the high dimensionality of these datasets can introduce significant "noise," making it difficult to derive actionable insights. In particular, the High-Dimensional Low-Sample-Size (HDLSS) problem is challenging in omics research, where the risk of overfitting in machine learning (ML) models can reduce the generalizability of findings. Addressing this issue requires robust data preprocessing and advanced computational techniques, that many legacy data infrastructures are not designed to handle.
Standardization and Interoperability
Regulatory Considerations
Ensuring that omics data are accessible while maintaining patient privacy and adhering to regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR is a complex balancing act. This challenge is heightened in a global research environment where data is often shared across different jurisdictions . In addition, as more genetics data are being used in diagnostic settings or for training machine learning models for predicting disease risk (such as polygenic risk scoring), the ability to track all aspects of the training process—from data acquisition and quality control to model training and explainability—has become increasingly critical.
User Experience
The pharmaceutical industry benefits from access to a diverse range of professionals, including IT specialists, data scientists, medical researchers, and bench scientists conducting complex experiments on various biological samples. Most existing data platforms, built on different technologies—spanning High-Performance Computing (HPC), traditional data warehouses and different native cloud services—require significant technical maintenance to adapt to the rapidly evolving landscape of omics data.
Moreover, access to insights by non-technical team members with domain knowledge is hindered due to the complexity of these systems and the steep learning curve associated with their use. This challenge creates a significant barrier to effective collaboration and data-driven decision-making within life sciences organizations.
Rise of GenAI Applications
Training new foundation models using multi-omics data is revolutionizing biomedical research and drug discovery. For example, with the rise of single-cell omics data, models like scGPT and Geneformer leverage large-scale multi-omics datasets to predict drug responses and identify new therapeutic targets, driving advancements in personalized medicine. Companies such as EvolutionaryScale and Profulent.bio have trained large language models (LLMs) for generating new synthetic proteins based on multiomics data. However, operationalizing these models presents significant challenges, particularly in terms of training efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The computational demands of processing vast datasets require advanced infrastructure, that can handle both data management and cost-effective training of such large models on massive amounts of multi-modal data.

A Value Realization Framework for Generative AI
Are your board of directors and executive team ready to transform your business with the latest technology, or will you be left behind as your competitors accelerate their adoption?
The transformative power of Generative AI (GenAI) applications is impacting industries across the globe, promising not only enhanced efficiency but also new avenues for value creation.
According to the latest research by PwC , a significant 70 percent of CEOs anticipate that GenAI will fundamentally change how their companies operate in the next three years.
Let's explore the key insights from PwC's report, focusing on the GenAI "Value Realization Flywheel" and its implications for businesses seeking to harness this methodology.
The Promise of GenAI Across Industries
Generative AI is poised to revolutionize various business sectors, with software companies potentially seeing a 20 percentage-point increase in their profit margins.
Even industries with modest projected gains, such as transport and logistics, could benefit from a 1 percentage point profit increase, highlighting GenAI's broad applicability.
These figures, while promising, are contingent on integrating GenAI into existing operating models without accounting for the costs of development and deployment. Nevertheless, the potential for market disruption and innovation-led digital business growth is substantial.
Understanding the GenAI Value Realization Flywheel
PwC introduces the GenAI Value Realization Flywheel as a strategic framework to guide leaders and their organizations in maximizing GenAI's commercial potential.
This concept and methodology draws inspiration from the flywheel mechanism, where initial efforts to generate momentum lead to sustained energy and value creation over time.
The PwC flywheel approach emphasizes:
Value Hypothesis: Establishing a strategic assessment of GenAI's potential business value, informed by organizational goals and industry benchmarks.
Prioritization of Use Cases: Identifying and focusing on key GenAI applications that promise the most significant return on investment (ROI).
Deployment and Learning: Testing GenAI solutions in controlled environments to refine and optimize lessons learned before a broader rollout.
Cost and Carbon Evaluation: Assessing the financial and environmental impacts of GenAI implementation to ensure sustainable practices.
Strategic Steps for GenAI Implementation
The flywheel framework outlines a structured approach to GenAI deployment, emphasizing the importance of a responsible and strategic rollout. Key methodology steps include:
Create Your Value Hypothesis
Organizations must begin by crafting a GenAI value hypothesis that considers both the immediate efficiency gains and the long-term strategic potential for reinvention.
The PwC research indicates that up to 40 percent of time spent on routine tasks could be optimized through GenAI, underscoring the strategic importance of focusing on efficiency improvements while keeping an eye on transformative opportunities.
Prioritize Key Use Cases
Focusing on the top five GenAI use cases can yield 50 percent to 80 percent of the overall value derived from the technology. For instance, in the luxury sector, GenAI can drive hyper-personalized marketing, while in software development, it can enhance productivity by automating code generation.
Select Foundational GenAI Tools
Choosing the right GenAI tools is crucial to avoid future tech debt. Organizations should balance robustness with adaptability, selecting foundational models that can scale and integrate with existing systems. This may involve using public GenAI models or developing bespoke solutions for sensitive data applications.
Assess Cost and Carbon Impact
Evaluating the cost implications of GenAI deployment is essential, not only in financial terms but also in considering other factors. While GenAI can be energy-intensive, it also offers opportunities for efficiency gains that can offset emissions from other sources.
Develop, Deploy, Test, and Learn
Continuous testing and iteration are vital in the rapidly evolving GenAI applications landscape. Organizations should adopt a flexible implementation approach, learning from each deployment to refine strategies and maximize value realization.
A Call to Action for Senior Executives
As GenAI tools and services continue to evolve, it presents both opportunities and challenges for business leaders. Senior executives should proactively engage with these new tools, considering their potential to drive workflow productivity and business model innovation.
Seeking industry-specific ROI proof points can provide valuable insights and guidance. By using an informed approach, organizations can position themselves at the forefront of GenAI adoption, unlocking new avenues for digital business growth and value creation.
However, GenAI vendor proposals should go beyond basic financial ROI assessments, providing insights on how to achieve the desired business outcome. A credible ROI estimate will be accompanied by a realistic deployment execution plan, making the outcome attainable.
The GenAI Value Realization Flywheel offers a comprehensive framework that forward-thinking organizations can apply. Line of business managers can achieve their goal of gaining C-suite approval for their project, once they've fully developed the GenAI business case.

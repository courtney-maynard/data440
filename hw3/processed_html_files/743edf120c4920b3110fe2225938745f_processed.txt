Welcome to the State of Alaska’s Online Voter Registration System
To use the Online Voter Registration System, you must have a valid Alaska driver's license or state ID card and 
                the information you enter when registering must match the information on your Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV) record.  
                If you do not have a valid Alaska driver's license or state ID, or your information cannot be validated, you may select to register 
                using a paper registration form.
You may use this system to 1) Register to vote or 2) Update your Voter Registration.

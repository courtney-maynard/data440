Welcome to Camp Tintri's Geek Out demo! Plenty of fresh mountain air, sunshine glistening across Hyper-V Lake, and the sweet sounds of "Tin-tin-tin... Tri-tri-tri..." rustling through the bushes. At least we hope that's what's rustling in the bushes...
Join us Wednesday October 16th 10 AM PT/1 PM ET/6 PM GMT for our Geek Out! Technology Demo Series - Wednesday the 16th! Den Leader Chris Gallamore will take campers down to Hyper-V Lake for adventures and activities to help your organization avoid horrors in the data center!
Enhance your visibility across storage, host, network, and hypervisor to avoid running into any killer issues in your data center!
Be the last one standing as Tintri technology boosts your performance with sub-millisecond latencies and fully utilized capacity to curb VM sprawl!
Slash through your storage footprint with a 6x reduction in size with a 60x management reduction!
With Tintri technology for Hyper-V, your organization's data will be poised to outlast the competition and live to tell the tale. (Until the sequel, at least). Sign up today!
All attendees will be entered into a drawing for a chance to win a custom branded Nintendo Switch! ( Terms and conditions )

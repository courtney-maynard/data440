Some notes:
Not listed among the Patriots’ inactives are wide receiver Kendrick Bourne (knee) and safety Marte Mapu (calf). Bourne is returning off of the PUP list after tearing his ACL last year. Mapu missed the first four weeks of the season on injured reserve. Mapu, Jaylinn Hawkins and Dell Pettus are expected to replace Peppers and Dugger.
The Patriots will dress five wide receivers in Bourne’s return. He’ll play alongside DeMario Douglas, rookie Ja’Lynn Polk, Tyquan Thornton and Kayshon Boutte. Osborn missed practice this week with a shoulder injury. Rookie Javon Baker is a healthy scratch.
Kromah, a rookie undrafted free agent, has yet to make his Patriots debut. The Patriots elevated Ochaun Mathis from the practice squad.
The Patriots will go with just two tight ends in Hunter Henry and Austin Hooper with Bell a healthy scratch.
Milton can only enter the game if Jacoby Brissett and Drake Maye both get injured.
The Patriots will dress nine offensive linemen: Vederian Lowe, Michael Jordan, Nick Leverett, Mike Onwenu, Demontrey Jacobs, Bryan Hudson, Sidy Sow, Laydeon Robinson and Zachary Thomas.

THERE ARE 2 TYPES OF FORMULAS
During 20 years of intensive nutritional research in the former Soviet Union, blends of whole food nutrient dense algae were tested with over 20 species of animals. The blends were adapted into different formulas to accommodate nutritional needs for humans and animals. Today there are two types of formulas, one called BIOSUPERFOOD adapted for humans, while the original animal formulas are called BIOPREPARATION and are suggested for your animal companions.

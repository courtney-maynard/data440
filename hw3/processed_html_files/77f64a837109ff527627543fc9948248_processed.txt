The Denver Broncos are rolling out their Orange Crush throwback uniforms, worn from 1968 to 1996 against the Las Vegas Raiders . The look includes blue helmets with the "D'' on the side featuring a snorting Bronco inside it. In honor of their 30th season, the Jacksonville Jaguars will wear "Prowler Throwbacks" against the Indianapolis Colts . Because of what is projected to be the hottest game in the 11-year history at Levi's Stadium , the San Francisco 49ers made a last-minute change to rock their throwback threads.
The Houston Texans are debuting their "H-Town Blue" alternate look against the Buffalo Bills , who are complementing it by wearing all white.
Here are the uniforms for all NFL teams in action in Week 5 (excluding the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Atlanta Falcons , who played Thursday).

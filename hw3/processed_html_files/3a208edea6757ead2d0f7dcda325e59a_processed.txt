Lying Fox again! We know those tax cuts were for the Rich! The other small one for regular people is set to sunset!

Putting the truth out as opposed to the lied told by Harris and Waltz. Every middle American knows that they were much better off during the Trump years because he is not a communist and actually supports tax breaks for all! He also understands and studied economics as opposed to those two dummies!

Science and ELD: Providing designated ELD in Science Classroom
PRESENTATION
New Orleans Ernest N. Morial Convention Center – 275
STRAND: Curriculum and Assessment
This workshop addresses the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) by showcasing how designated English Language Development (ELD) standards are embedded in an 8th grade integrated course and a 9th grade Physics in the Universe course. Both NGSS and ELD standards are in the model provided to the participants.
TAKEAWAYS:
Long term English Language Learners are marginalized as they are denied elective courses by being placed in an ELD class. Research also shows that language is better acquired through experience, of which an NGSS class is the perfect setting for both science and language.

Leadership for Equity through the Implementation of High-Quality Instructional Materials
HANDS-ON WORKSHOP
New Orleans Ernest N. Morial Convention Center – 267
STRAND: Curriculum and Assessment
Far too often, equity efforts are relegated to the sidelines instead of being embedded in core curriculum leadership tasks. Join us to consider how anchoring science leadership in equity principles can remove barriers to science teaching and learning through curriculum implementation efforts.
TAKEAWAYS:
The implementation of high-quality instructional materials (HQIM) can lead to more equitable systems when barriers to equity are confronted and removed. The process of confronting barriers includes collaborating for justice, taking small actions to learn, and continual reflection and revision of implementation plans based on data.
SPEAKERS:
Susan Gomez Zwiep (BSCS Science Learning: Colorado Springs, CO), Jenine Cotton-Proby (BSCS Science Learning: Colorado Springs, CO), Janna Mahfoud (BSCS Science Learning: Colorado Springs, CO)

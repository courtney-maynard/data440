WHY OUR SKIN LOOKS BETTER WHEN WE SLEEP FOR 8 HOURS.
During the first three hours, our body produces HGH (Human Growth Hormone) which is necessary, as we age, to maintain youthful skin appearance.
The middle two hours of sleep is when melatonin is increased.  Melatonin acts as an antioxidant that helps protect the skin from damaging free radicals.
In the final three hours, or during the active REM sleep stage, levels of cortisol (a stress hormone) decrease.  The skin’s temperature also drops which allows muscles to relax and become immobile, giving skin its deepest recovery of the night.
SLEEP ROUTINE FOR BETTER SKIN:
>>  Sleep 7 to 9 hours a night (go to bed no later than 10 pm)
>> Your bedroom should be filled with comfy sheets (and pillows!), so there’s no pulling of skin while sleeping!
>> Keep up on personal hygiene before bedtime by taking warm showers or baths–don’t forget lip balm!–removing makeup, wearing comfortable cotton pajamas, etc.; these things will help ensure an amazing snooze every time!
>>  Avoid caffeine within 2 hours of going to bed; alcohol in any form too close as well since they both can cause dehydration which leads to poor quality sleep patterns over time.
>>  There’s nothing better than curling up in bed with a cool breeze and an open window. Not to mention, you’ll sleep like  a baby!
>>  Sleep on back rather than stomach as this minimizes skin sagging and eye puffiness.
>>  Put your phone on silent mode and turn off the television at least two hours before you go to bed. The bright light from electronic screens can disrupt melatonin production, which interferes with sleep patterns.
>>   Put a few drops of lavender essential oil on your pillow
GETTING PLENTY OF SLEEP WILL RESULT IN:
• minimizing dark under-eye circles or bags (If you get enough sleep, the blood vessels will not dilate.)
• less sagging and minimized wrinkles (Skin makes new collagen when you sleep.)
• improved overall skin health (Your skin is more receptive to beauty products when you’re asleep.)
• better skin hydration (When you are sleeping, your skin is able to recover moisture.)
• healthy, rosy glow (Your body boosts blood flow to the skin while you snooze.)
• less pollution and sun exposure damage (You make anti-inflammatory cytokines while you sleep. They  help reduce the impact of damages done throughout the day.)
WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU PULLED AN “ALL NIGHTER”:
* place cold cucumber slices on your face
* exfoliate thoroughly to promote blood flow
* eat foods rich in antioxidants
* drink plenty of water

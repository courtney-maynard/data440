DVAM 2024: Heal, Hold & Center
Domestic Violence Awareness Month (DVAM) is a national campaign dedicated to raising awareness about domestic violence. Every October, organizations and individuals unite across the country for a national effort to uplift the needs, voices, and experiences of survivors. Congress declared the month of October to be Domestic Violence Awareness Month in 1989.
For DVAM 2024, the Domestic Violence Awareness Project is proud to build on the theme Heal, Hold & Center, first launched in 2023. This DVAM and beyond, we must work together, embrace the many cultural ways we can heal from violence and oppression, commit to holding space for survivors, and center those most marginalized in all of our efforts to end domestic violence. As we heal, hold, and center survivors, especially those navigating anti-Blackness and other systems of oppression, we remain grounded in the knowledge that there is no survivor justice without racial justice.
Call for Unity: Connective Action for DVAM 2024
This year’s National Call for Unity is an opportunity for “Connective Action” around the DVAM 2024 theme, Heal, Hold & Center. This is an intentional pause and moment of recognition and togetherness for advocates and survivors across the country. Who do you want to celebrate? This #CallforUnity asks each of us to commit to reconnection with those we honor and appreciate in this work to end and heal from domestic violence. Tag an advocate who embodies what it means to Heal, Hold & Center survivors. Post your commitment to connective action for DVAM 2024 on your social media platforms at #CallforUnity throughout the month of October.

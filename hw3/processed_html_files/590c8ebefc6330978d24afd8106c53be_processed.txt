Week 5 of the NFL season is underway
Link Copied
The Baltimore Ravens and Cincinnati Bengals are two AFC North teams in various stages of righting the ship. The Ravens have won two straight after a disappointing 0-2 start and have been steamrolling opposing defenses on the ground. Baltimore is averaging 220.3 rushing yards per game. That's nearly 45 yards clear of the Packers, the No. 2-ranked rushing team at 174.5 yards per game. The Bengals, on the other hand, are 1-3 and got their first win of the season just last week at Carolina. The connection between Joe Burrow and Ja'Marr Chase, who missed all of the preseason due to a contract dispute, is still a work in progress.
The Ravens have more to gain by winning, but the Bengals have more to lose by losing. Who will come out on top?

Panthers bringing in an old friend at QB
As the Panthers play out the final minutes of their blowout defeat against the Bears, they've brought in an old friend at quarterback to replace (former?) savior Andy Dalton.
Bryce Young is in at quarterback for the Panthers.

Something to think about...
The Miami Dolphins, the New York Jets, and the Cleveland Browns are just a few of the teams that told Joe Flacco they were not interested in him this off-season.

Joe Flacco? Yeah he's still throwing touchdowns.
What else do you say at this point? Flacco is destroying the Jaguars. Period.
FLACCO TO PIERCE FOR A 65-YARD TD TO TIE IT.
JOE FLACCO MAGIC.

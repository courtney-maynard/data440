Help a homeless disabled trans guy raise enough for a deposit for an apartment and survive in the mean time
Hello! I’m River I’m a 23 year old disabled trans guy and I’m currently (about to be) homeless so I made this go fund me to hopefully get some help to survive if I can get the funds for a deposit in time I do potentially have an apartment I can move into on December 10th with two friends of mine but only if I can get enough for the deposit in time so I am hoping to get help to make enough for my portion of the deposit which would be $2500 (a third of first/last security) I am also needing an additional minimum of $1000 for a bed/dresser/maybe some new clothes since I am unfortunately loosing a lot of stuff due to being homeless and then I am also looking to have a bit of savings to use while I’m homeless so I can maybe get a hotel when I can’t find a place to stay when it gets too cold which would probably be ~$1200 as the cheapest hotels in the area I have to stay in is $90 a night any help to make my goal would be so appreciated being kicked out is really a blessing in disguise as getting this place and moving forward in life is really important to me as I’ll finally be able to be free from my abusive transphobic family start my transition so big thanks for any help given!

Real Stories, Real Impact
Don't just take our word for it. Hear from the educators who've experienced growth through our professional development courses.
The cost compared to others is just phenomenal. The teachers are excited, it’s convenient, it’s something in which teachers can relate to, and it’s current. It is a tool that you can’t go wrong with using and just the fact that teachers migrate to it, it just sticks with them.

One half-hour SimpleK12 webinar was filled with more information than I receive at an all-day session elsewhere.

We’re using SimpleK12 because it’s a powerful tool for teachers. Anytime you get a committed group of teachers working together for a similar cause, amazing things happen. That’s what’s happened in the Teacher Learning Community.

Our Mission
Founded in 1985, we’ve been at the forefront of online professional development for educators for decades. Our flagship product, ‘Seminar-on-a-Disk,' was an innovative solution for self-paced learning. With the evolution of digital technology, we launched SimpleK12, an online community for educators, and ‘How to Master,' our first virtual platform.
The COVID-19 pandemic posed new challenges, but we responded with the tools and resources teachers needed for the sudden shift to virtual teaching. Now, as part of the Teachers of Tomorrow family, we continue to support educators from their initial certification to ongoing professional growth.
As the world evolves, so do we, staying committed to empowering educators through online professional development, equipping them with the knowledge and skills required to make a profound impact.

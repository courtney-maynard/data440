Tim Moran is organizing this fundraiser.
Donation protected
My name is Tim Moran. I'm a CPA in Marshall, NC. I'm working with my friend John Campbell out of Mars Hill, NC to help our community. We were some of the fortunate ones and are working to help our community and those surrounding us....
This fund will be used to support communities in WNC and the surrounding areas affected by Hurricane Helene. Funds donated will be used primarily for rural and disadvantaged communities that will likely have more trouble accessing needed resources in the coming months. Funds will be run through the nonprofit Rural Relief Fund of WNC, Inc (established, EIN available upon request).
Funds will first go to buy needed essentials - food, water, clothing, baby needs, pet needs, generators, PPE for cleanup, etc.
As cleanup progresses we will continue to use funds for those services and will also expand to helping area individuals and small businesses, supporting government relief efforts including reconstruction.
We will have a website or whatever up if we get bigger and will publicize details of expenditures as soon as possible. We have a loose supply chain in place already, supporting efforts in Madison County and Burnsville. We are working to bring Barnardsville into the network next and will expand from there.

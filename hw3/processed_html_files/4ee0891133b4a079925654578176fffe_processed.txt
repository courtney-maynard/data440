Even while domestic and international problems have moved political news further down the page, that does not mean that voters are not paying attention to the presidential election in 2024. People are looking for candidates to provide solutions to the challenges that are confronting Americans, and they want answers to the issues they have.
One of the candidates has been asked a lot of questions, but he has been unable to provide satisfactory responses, whether the inquiries have been about the economy or about international affairs. These days, information spreads quickly, and President Joe Biden has been inundated with a torrent of negative reports. The most recent polling data isn’t going to make the sitting president pleased, and the situation has become even worse.

According to a poll conducted on Thursday, The Daily Caller is reporting that Biden is trailing former President Donald Trump in a number of important swing states for a hypothetical battle in 2024. The poll was conducted on Thursday. According to a survey conducted by Bloomberg News and Morning Consult, Trump is currently ahead of Biden in the swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin with 47%, while Biden only has 43% of the vote.

In addition, voters continue to place a significant emphasis on economic issues in this election year. A majority of voters in swing states believe that the economy is in better shape under the leadership of Trump than it is under the leadership of Biden. In fact, 49% of voters trust Trump more than they trust Biden on the subject, while just 35% of voters trust Biden.
When it comes to Bidenomics, also known as the economic platform for the president’s reelection campaign, this voter poll reveals an overwhelming amount of pessimism. According to the poll, only 29% of respondents felt it has been beneficial for the economy, while 49% said it has been detrimental. Sixty-five percent of people who believed the economy was the most important issue were against how Biden handled the situation, while fourteen percent agreed with him.

These most current polling results stand in stark contrast to Trump’s success during his first run for re-election, when he was seeking a second term. When he ran against Hillary Clinton in 2016, Donald Trump won the states of Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, and Pennsylvania. However, Joe Biden won all of the same states in 2020. Trump was victorious in North Carolina in both presidential elections, while the Democratic nominee was victorious in Nevada.
Trump’s victory over Biden might also be attributed to the fact that people have placed a greater emphasis on other problems. According to the survey, people in swing states had greater faith in Trump than they did in Biden to handle important issues including immigration, crime, U.S.-China ties, guns, the Russia-Ukraine war, regulation of digital companies, housing, infrastructure, labor, and unions. On subjects that are important to liberals, such as education and schools, Social Security and Medicare, health care, abortion, and climate change, President Joe Biden performed better than Donald Trump.

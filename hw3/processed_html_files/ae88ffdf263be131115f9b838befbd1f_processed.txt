Your Own Home?

This is an estimate based on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 7.242% interest, 20% down payment, $120/mo homeowners insurance, and the average property tax rate of 10.90 in the Boston area. Actual interest rates, property taxes, and homeowners insurance will vary. Does not include additional expenses or fees such as closing costs, PMI, or HOA fees. Buyers must complete their own due diligence based on current market conditions.

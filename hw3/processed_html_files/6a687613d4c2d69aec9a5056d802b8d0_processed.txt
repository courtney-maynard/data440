Homeowners know insurance premiums have driven the cost of owning a home in Florida even higher over the last few years, and while the legislature has made some progress driving down costs, Governor Desantis added a specific tax break which could really help South Florida.

The 1.5 billion dollar tax bill signed Tuesday offers relief for everything from road tolls to disaster supplies.
One new addition this year adds a break on homeowners insurance taxes.
“We are waving all taxes on insurance premiums for a full year, for homeowners polices and flood insurance polices, so we are trying to provide relief," said Desantis.
That sounds great, but we wanted to know how much that will save the average homeowner?
We asked Jared Mancil, an agent who has seen first hand the struggles his customers have had with skyrocketing insurance prices.
“To me, this has been a complete disaster, we're in a position right now where we have families that were paying only about $1,800, just three or four years ago. Now those same families are paying between 5 and $6000." said Mancil.
With numbers that high, this tax break is nice, but it’s not going to pay for your next vacation.
“We all appreciate each and every adjustment we can make, the reality is I think most families are going to stand to save maybe $100 a year or less from that tax relief,” said Mancil.
What Jared says could make a difference, is another topic the governor touched on, the “My Safe Florida Home” program.
An additional $200 million was signed in April for the My Safe Florida Home Program.
“That program is so good that they'll actually match you, for every dollar that you agree to spend towards home hardening, which would be maybe a new roof, or storm shutters or impact glass, the state of Florida is actually contributing two for one, and that cap is up to $10,000 as well.” said Mancil.

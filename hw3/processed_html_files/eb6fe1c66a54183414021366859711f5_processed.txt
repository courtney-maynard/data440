About Cardinal Elite Academy Lacrosse
Cardinal Elite Lacrosse Academy is based out of Louisville KY. Our Academy programs are open to all players no matter what school or club you play for! We have partnered with Never Satisfied Performance to add an element of strength and development alongside our lacrosse training!
Our mission as a program is to be able to teach life lessons through the game, we all love. Lacrosse allows us to mentor each player in learning how to embrace and attack challenges head-on. Through these challenges, we teach them that there is no such thing as failure but, opportunities to learn. This mentality channels one’s confidence and efforts to overcome obstacles, both in lacrosse and in life.

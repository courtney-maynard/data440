Our Nature & Climate debates bring candidates in your riding together to discuss conservation, climate policy, and environmental issues. Hear what they have to say, ask candidates questions directly, and make your community’s concerns heard this election. This debate is co-hosted with local youth from our Young Leaders in Conservation Program (YLICP). Young people are especially encouraged to attend and participate. CPAWS-BC will be moderating the debates and asking candidates about their positions on various environmental issues, followed by an open audience Q&A.
Join us for food and refreshments when doors open, at no charge. Please come mingle and share your views with the candidates. Register now to save your seat!

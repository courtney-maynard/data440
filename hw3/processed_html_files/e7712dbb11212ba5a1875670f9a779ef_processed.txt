Sometimes you just need another adult on the team to help kids learn and develop. After years of trying to help our son improve his executive functioning skills, it's nice to have another voice reinforcing what we've been saying for years.
Response from the owner: Hi Stephanie,Thank you so much for your thoughtful review! We’re glad to hear that our support has made a positive difference for your son. It’s so important to have a team approach when developing skills like executive functioning, and we’re thrilled to be that additional, trusted voice alongside you.
Kristen has provided great help for me in preparing my college applications! I started meeting with her as a sophomore, and she helped me tailor my extracurriculars to create a narrative and recommended I start a National English Honor Society chapter at my school, which is now a central point of my application. As a senior now, she is great with editing my essays and taking me through the complex process of submitting applications. I'd highly recommend Educational Connections Tutoring!

Our tutor has been instrumental in giving our high school son more confidence in his organizational skills and school work. He is motivated to do more work at school and get help from teachers without our asking. He is taking harder classes as a result. We have been very pleased with the entire experience.
Response from the owner: This is outstanding to hear, Melissa! Congratulations to your son for working hard and building the skills he needs to feel more confident and motivated!
We have utilized this service for our son. Through Educational Connections, our son has been able to better organize his train of thought towards his school work, and, specifically, map out an approach to completing all aspects of the college application process. Maria has both provided a foundation for him heading to college, but created the courage that his professional goal is attainable through organization.
Response from the owner: Thank you, Steve, for sharing your son’s journey with Educational Connections! We're so glad to hear that working with Maria has helped him build the organizational skills and confidence needed for both his schoolwork and the college application process. It's wonderful to know that these skills have not only laid a foundation for his future but also empowered him to believe in his professional goals. We’re honored to be part of his success, and we wish him all the best as he heads to college. Thanks again for your trust in our services!

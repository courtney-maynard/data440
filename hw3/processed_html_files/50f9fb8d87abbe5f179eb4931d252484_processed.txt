Over 3000 years ago, the telepath and shapeshifting Elysians were the apex species on the other side of our galaxy. Technologically and socially advanced, they extended their lives through cloning and thought themselves unmatched.
Until they met the Zon: an invasive, conquering species that used bio-weapons against the Elysians' delicate biology.
Facing tremendous losses, an Elysian coalition of the cunning, brilliant, and brave sought a solution. The depleted Elysians found it in an unexpected place: Earth.
As they lost their homeworlds, they regrouped with humanity in a struggle, with two cultures becoming one. Two species, one destiny.
Discover the epic tale of survival, sacrifice, and unity.

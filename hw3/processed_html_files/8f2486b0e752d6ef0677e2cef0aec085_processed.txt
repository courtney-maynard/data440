The Bloomberg Canadian Finance Conference, proudly sponsored by National Bank of Canada Financial Markets, brings together finance, government and business leaders from across various sectors to discuss advancements in their fields and how they are sustaining their leadership going forward. 2024 marks the 12-year anniversary of our Canada-focused event, and continues the tradition of providing timely, actionable insights and strategies for a global audience of leaders and decision-makers.
We look forward to welcoming to the stage a wide variety of Ministers and CEOs to discuss how they are leveraging technology and negotiating lingering inflation, geopolitical disruptions, the effects of climate change, and changes in consumer behavior. The event will feature ample opportunity to network with speakers and peers. Join us to hear the latest developments in Canadian business and government initiatives and meet the people in position to implement impactful strategies for building a strong and resilient economy and society.

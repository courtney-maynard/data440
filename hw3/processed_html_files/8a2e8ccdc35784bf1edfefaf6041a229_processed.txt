Aloha Marci!
The shoulder season has arrived, and it’s the ideal time to enjoy all that the island offers, with more availability and less bustle. With the summer crowds thinning out, you’ll enjoy a more relaxed island experience—fewer crowds, shorter wait times at restaurants, and plenty of open spots for activities you’ve been dreaming about.
Plus, it's the perfect time to snag great deals on accommodations and flights. The cooler temperatures and the refreshing drop in humidity make it an ideal time for outdoor adventures, whether you’re lounging on the beach or exploring Maui’s scenic landscapes.
This fall, Maui is buzzing with exciting local events for both visitors and locals alike. And we’re happy to share the latest progress from Lāhainā! All 1,390 residential properties have already been cleared, ahead of the January deadline, and 62% of commercial properties are on track to be cleared by or before February 2025. We're eager to see the island thrive again and appreciate visitors' support as we continue on this long road to recovery.
Join us this fall for an unforgettable experience, and be sure to take advantage of our special rates on accommodations!
Warmest Aloha,

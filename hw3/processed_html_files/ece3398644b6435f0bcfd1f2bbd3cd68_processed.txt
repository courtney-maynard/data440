Honey, your friend in Canada doesn't know anything. You need to stop spreading the lies. You are part of the problem.  You spreading these lies is putting all the workers like FEMA, THE UTILITY WORKERS, THE EVERYDAY HELPERS IN DANGER. DO NOT SPREAD THESE LIES. YOU COULD COST SOMEONE THEIR LIVES. STOP!!.

You're right. The people are spreading these lies are trump's liers. FEMA,THE RED CROSS, THE GROUPS THAT ARE HELPING.  Don't believe anything Trump and Vance are saying. They are just trying to win votes by undermining Biden and Harris.

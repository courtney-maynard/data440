Keep Alex Jones On The Air Emergency Fundraiser
The globalists are in full panic mode and are doing everything they can to take the number one American populist broadcast off of the air.
Democrat party operatives are simultaneously attempting in federal and state court to close InfoWars forever. Most importantly, they have publicly filed to appoint a receiver over Alex Jones personally, a completely illegal move that violates the 13th amendment prohibition against slavery.
Alex Jones intends to stay on the air one way or another, but he cannot do it without you taking action right now.
Your donations are vital to ensure that Jones can mount a legal defense and continue to stay on the air at this historic time in the battle not only for our republic but for humanity itself.
As President Trump has rightly stated hundreds of times, "They’re not after me, they’re after you—I’m just in the way," when you stand with Alex Jones in the face of the globalist onslaught you are standing up not only for yourself but your family, your country, and God.
Again, your desperately needed donations will fund Alex Jones’ legal defense and expenses associated with staying on the air that are essential to him being able to stay on the air regardless of what happens to InfoWars.
We the people have turned the tide but evil is striking back. Without your support the enemies of humanity will win.
Thank you,

I can't imagine not being able to go online, find you & listen to any one of your broadcasts any time.  I spend time with you every day of the week, without fail!  You feed our brain power, bring things full circle, impassion our decencies and fire us up, Alex!  I'm beyond grateful for your insights and that you are man enough & empowered enough to keep going, despite opposition!  Thank You!

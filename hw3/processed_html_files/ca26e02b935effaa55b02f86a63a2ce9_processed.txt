After I saw this movie I did a little reading, a little research about what Peele was saying in this film. From Wikipedia, Peele said:
“I wrote it in a time when we were a little bit worried about the future of cinema. So the first thing I knew is I wanted to create a spectacle. I wanted to create something that the audience would have to come see.” Speaking to GQ, Peele stated, “So much of what this world was experiencing was this overload of spectacle, and kind of a low point of our addiction to spectacle.” He added that he “wrote [the film] trapped inside, and so I knew I wanted to make something that was about the sky. I knew the world would want to be outside and at the same time, I knew we had this newfound fear from this trauma, from this time of what it meant to go outside. Can we go outside? So I slipped some of that stuff in.”
While that is in the film,  I just felt that a lot of other things he’d added in the film took away (for me) the initial danger, the creature in the sky.

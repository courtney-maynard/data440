Introduction
The Freedom Foundation Citizens Task Force (FFCTF), a crucial part of the FormerFedsGroup Freedom Foundation, is a collective of determined individuals united by the harm they or their loved ones have suffered due to shifts away from the protections of the US Constitution and Nuremberg protocols during the COVID-19 crisis. The FFCTF is more than a group; it’s a movement committed to protecting individual dignity, promoting justice, and holding those responsible accountable. We believe in the primacy of the US Constitution and the protection of individual freedoms.
Our Objective
The FFCTF’s main goal is to highlight the untold sufferings and injustices many have faced due to international control over national governance, particularly in healthcare. We challenge the narrative that has led to widespread malpractice and negligence during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, our mission includes opposing threats to financial privacy and individual freedoms posed by Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and defending the fundamental rights of individuals involved in the January 6 events. We believe in the power of shared experiences and collective action to drive change and foster healing.
Activities and Roles
Members of the FFCTF engage in various activities, including:
Documentation: Members share their personal stories about the impacts of COVID policies, protocols, and mandates. These stories of COVID-related crimes against humanity are archived and shared to ensure they are remembered and highlight the human cost of these policies.
Support and Solidarity: The Task Force offers a platform for victims and their families to connect, share resources, and support each other. Regular support group meetings provide a space for healing and understanding, ensuring no one feels alone in their struggle.
Advocacy and Awareness: The FFCTF raises public awareness about the malpractices and injustices resulting from international governance over national sovereignty during the pandemic. This involves engaging with the media, participating in public forums, and working with sympathetic policymakers to drive change.
Legal and Policy Initiatives: Seeking accountability is a key part of our mission. We collaborate with legal professionals to explore avenues for justice and advocate for policy reforms that protect individual freedoms and prevent future tragedies.
Opposition to Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs): We view CBDCs as a threat to financial privacy and individual freedoms, potentially leading to government surveillance and control over personal finances. We raise awareness about these dangers and advocate for alternatives that protect financial privacy.
Defense of January 6 Freedom: We stand in defense of those unjustly targeted for their involvement in the January 6 events, supporting their fundamental rights to protest and free speech. We provide support to individuals facing legal repercussions and work to uphold their constitutional rights.

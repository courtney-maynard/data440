Looking for a festive seasonal snack board? This Fall Harvest Snack Board is loaded with fresh fruit, savory cheese and crackers, and even some caramel dip for the ultimate Fall treat. This fruit and cheese platter is great for an appetizer on football Sundays, at Fall gatherings, or even on Thanksgiving!
We have been loving snacking on platters like this more and more often. The kids and I assemble this together and then everyone enjoys eating off of it. Sometime we make boards for our main meals like our Taco Board and our Ultimate Breakfast Board . Snack boards are great because everyone can kind of pick and choose what they want to eat and it can be a family activity for assembling.
A family snack board with your favorite fall flavors! Assemble this family-size Fall Harvest snack board, full of red and green apples, pears, grapes, caramel dip, cheese, crackers and more for your family movie or game night. Everyone can graze on their favorite and there’s no pots or pans to clean up! So grab the kids, grab out some ingredients, and have fun customizing your own boards!

Key Ingredients for this Fall Harvest Snack Board
Apples – nothing says Fall like fresh apples! We used both red and green apples for color.
Pear – pears are in season in Fall, too. They are sweet, flavorful, and loaded with great benefits. Full of antioxidants, Vitamin C, and potassium.
Brie Cheese
Cheddar Cheese
Crackers
Grapes – we love grapes in our family. Check out the health benefits here !
Fig Jam
Almonds
Pretzels
We used a few decorative pumpkins on our board to make it more festive! If you have some Fall garland or any small decorations, feel free to add that (as long as everyone knows not to eat it). And if you prefer different types of cheese, you can add that as well. Load the tray up with your favorite flavored crackers or different shaped pretzels, too.
How to assemble this Fall Harvest Snack Board
First start by using a large cutting board or we love this cheese board set ! Then wash and prepare all of your fresh produce. We sliced our apples and pears and left the grapes on the vine. You can take them off but just put them in a small bowl or serving dish so that they don’t roll all over the place.
Scoop some caramel dip into a small bowl along with the fig jam. Place these bowls on the board. Then fill the board in with the cheeses, crackers, pretzels, and fruits. If you want to make a design, go for it. Otherwise just assemble in little sections.
Serve immediately or cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. And of course, ENJOY this snack board with your family and friends!

What to Pair with Your Fall Harvest Snack Board
To complement the flavors of your Fall Harvest Snack Board, consider serving some delicious nonalcoholic beverages alongside it. Apple cider, either hot or cold, is a classic fall drink that pairs perfectly with the apples and pears on the board. For a festive twist, try making a cider spritzer by mixing equal parts apple cider and sparkling water, and garnishing with a cinnamon stick. Another option is to make a fall-spiced tea, like chai or pumpkin spice, and serve it hot or over ice. You could also offer a variety of flavored lemonades, like cranberry or pomegranate, for a tart and refreshing contrast to the rich cheeses and sweet fruits.
How to Prep Your Snack Board Ahead of Time
To make assembling your Fall Harvest Snack Board easier, you can prep some of the components ahead of time. Slice the apples and pears up to a day in advance, and store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator. To prevent browning, toss the slices with a little lemon juice before storing. You can also slice the cheese and arrange it on the board a few hours before serving, then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to serve. The crackers, pretzels, and almonds can be portioned out into serving bowls and stored at room temperature until needed. When you’re ready to serve, simply arrange the prepped ingredients on the board and add the finishing touches like the caramel dip and fig jam.
Incorporating More Tastes of Fall
To give your Fall Harvest Snack Board even more autumn flavor, consider adding some seasonal ingredients and accompaniments. Swap out the regular crackers for gingersnap cookies or pumpkin-flavored crackers. Add a bowl of roasted pumpkin seeds or candied pecans for a crunchy and sweet treat. Include a variety of fall-themed cheeses, like cranberry cheddar or apple-smoked gouda. You could also offer a selection of fall-inspired dips and spreads, like pumpkin hummus or apple butter, to spread on the crackers and fruit slices. Don’t be afraid to get creative and experiment with different flavor combinations that evoke the cozy and comforting tastes of the season.
Storing Snack Board Leftovers
If you have any leftovers from your Fall Harvest Snack Board, it’s important to store them properly to maintain freshness and prevent spoilage. Any perishable items, like sliced fruits and cheeses, should be stored in airtight containers in the refrigerator. The apples and pears may brown slightly, but they will still be safe to eat for up to 2 days. The crackers, pretzels, and nuts can be stored at room temperature in resealable bags or airtight containers for up to a week. If you have any dips or spreads left over, transfer them to smaller containers and refrigerate for up to 3 days. When you’re ready to enjoy your leftovers, simply arrange them on a plate or board and let them come to room temperature before serving.

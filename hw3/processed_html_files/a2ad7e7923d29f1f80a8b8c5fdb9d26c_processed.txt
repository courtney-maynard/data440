A word from our President
Since March 2012, I have had the privilege of serving as the President of the Canadian Italian Advocates Organization. For those of you who may not be aware, CIAO has a long and rich history. It was founded in 1984 primarily with a view to promoting professional development among its members and the legal community as well as enhancing public legal education.
Vince A Pileggi President
It’s rare to find 
such warmth in addition to collegiality within

Congratulations. 
You’re doing a wonderful job and have a great 
atmosphere at 
CIAO.

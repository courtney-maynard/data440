Orchard Punch
Cowboys drink their apple cider with Pendleton®️ Original Whisky! The Orchard Punch is a delicious combination of sweet, tart apple cider, Angostura Bitters, and a splash of ginger ale for some fun fizziness. Add a few apple slices for a stylish garnish and enjoy the crisp fall weather with the perfect fall cocktail. It’s easy to make and even easier to drink!

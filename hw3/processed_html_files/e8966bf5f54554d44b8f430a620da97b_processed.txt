Farooq Abdullah Rules Out Post-Poll Alliance with BJP in J&K
Politics
Farooq Abdullah, the president of the National Conference (NC), has categorically dismissed any possibility of his party forming a post-election alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K). After the three-phase assembly elections, Abdullah stressed that any political party aligning with BJP would lose its relevance in the region. The National Conference, which competed in the elections in coalition with the Congress, stands firmly opposed to such an alignment, citing BJP's detrimental actions towards J&K's autonomy. Omar Abdullah and Iltija Mufti also criticized BJP's strategies, which they claim have undermined the state's powers. The elections were significant as they were conducted after the abrogation of Article 370 and the bifurcation of the region into Union territories. Statements from the NC and People's Democratic Party (PDP) leaders underline the continuing political tensions and concerns over regional autonomy and governance.

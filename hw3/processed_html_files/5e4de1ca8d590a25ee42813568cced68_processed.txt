Massachusetts law (M.G.L. c. 111, Section 24M) requires providers to report immunization information to a computerized immunization registry known as the Massachusetts Immunization Information System (MIIS). The MIIS stores immunization records for your child and your healthcare provider and can help prevent outbreaks of disease like measles and the flu. All information in the MIIS is kept secure and confidential. The MIIS allows information to be shared with health care providers, school nurses, local boards of health, state agencies concerned with immunization and Health plans for immunization rate improvement and quality improvement efforts for each plan’s membership. You have the right to object to the sharing of your child's immunization information across providers in the MIIS. For more information, please ask your healthcare provider, visit the MIIS website at www.mass.gov/dph/miis or contact the Massachusetts Immunization Program MIIS Help Desk directly at 617-983-4335.

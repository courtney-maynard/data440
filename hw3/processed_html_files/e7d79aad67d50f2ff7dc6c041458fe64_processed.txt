Two of Indiana’s U.S. Senate hopefuls will face off in a debate later this month, although the third candidate — Republican Congressman Jim Banks — is not expected to participate.
The Indiana Debate Commission will host a U.S. Senate debate from 7 to 8 p.m. Oct. 29, one week before the Nov. 5 general election.
Democrat Valerie McCray and Libertarian Andy Horning accepted the invitation to debate, IDC officials said. Along with Banks, the trio are vying to succeed Republican U.S. Sen. Mike Braun, who is seeking Indiana’s gubernatorial seat.
Banks’ campaign sent a statement in August to the ICC saying “Congressman Banks is focused on representing northeast Indiana in Congress, spending time with his family, and running a statewide campaign to be the next conservative U.S. Senator for Indiana. He will entertain debate options as we get closer to Election Day.”
Voters are invited to send in questions ahead of the debate, by Oct. 17, according to an IDC news release. They can do so on the commission’s website, www.indianadebatecommission.com , using the “Ask Your Question” link at the top of the homepage.
The candidates and tools you need to cast your vote.
Hoosiers whose questions are selected also may be offered the opportunity to ask their questions on pre-taped video to be broadcast during the hour-long debate, according to the IDC. Candidates do not receive the questions in advance from the commission, however.
The debate will stream live on the commission’s website. Local television stations may additionally air the feed. Viewers should check their local listing closer to debate night, the IDC advised.
Commission member Laura Merrifield Wilson, a political science professor at the University of Indianapolis, will moderate.
“The U.S. Senate race has received little attention statewide, leaving many voters eager to learn more about the candidates on their ballot and the positions they hold,” said Elizabeth Bennion, a political scientist and long-time debate organizer who agreed to lead the Commission in June 2024, in a statement. “We look forward to hosting an informative discussion about issues that matter to Hoosier voters.”
The governor’s race is a three-way between Republican Mike Braun, Democrat Jennifer McCormick and Libertarian Donald Rainwater. All three have agreed to participate in the debate, which will also be moderated by Merrifield Wilson.
Questions will be vetted by IDC and accepted through Oct. 11. Similar to the U.S. Senate debate, some Hoosiers could be invited to pre-record video questions. Gubernatorial candidates will debate for one hour and will not be allowed to review questions beforehand.

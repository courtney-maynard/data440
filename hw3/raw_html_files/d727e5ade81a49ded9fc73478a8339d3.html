<p>We had a few weeks and a few moves&rsquo; worth of threading the cable into our fifth wheel, and frankly that was more than enough. I was always worried about the proprietary ends of the Starlink becoming damaged because of their notorious fragility, and I didn&rsquo;t want to risk deforming the seals around the windows or slides as water damage is deadly to an RV. After exploring our fifth wheel and looking for potential entry points, my husband decided to go up through the void in the pin box and into the master closet. Keep reading for the DIY guide. I&rsquo;m really happy with how it turned out. <em>(If you&rsquo;re looking to start from the beginning, you&rsquo;ll find instructions for cutting and terminating the cable in part 1, <a href="https://looselyorderedchaos.com/?p=176">here</a>.)</em></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bringing-starlink-internet-inside-our-fifth-wheel">Bringing Starlink Internet Inside Our Fifth Wheel</h2>



<p>We considered several options. The first was the least invasive: we&rsquo;d simply mount the router in the wet bay and bring the cable up through the hole that existed for the water hoses. The problem is that the Starlink router is weak and couldn&rsquo;t provide a signal throughout our rig from there. Of course, there are those who are fine with coming in through a slide or window seal but over time you&rsquo;re going to deform your most important defenses against water. Needless to say, that&rsquo;s not an option we entertained.</p>



<p>The prior options being unacceptable led us look for a place to mount an RJ45 jack to breech the rig and place the Starlink router inside. At first we thought about bringing it up through the underbelly and into the space behind the dresser where wires are already routed and a hole already existed, but it was on the wrong side of the room from our network stuff. On top of that, our underbelly is usually quite full and I could see the cable or the jack getting damaged while we were digging through looking for something. We spent a couple of weeks trying to think what we were going to do.</p>

<p>My husband came to the rescue with the idea to mount a <a href="https://amzn.to/3SBbxYk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">waterproof RJ45 panel mount coupler</a> inside the pin box and come up into our closet. It&rsquo;s brilliant but simple: The metal surround of the pin box is going to offer extra protection from wind and rain and be invisible and out of the way when not in use. With our rig, coming up through the void in the pin box means coming up nearly dead center of the master closet. It&rsquo;s a little unfortunate, but I decided to make it work since much of our network equipment is already nearby.Keep reading for the step-by-step guide, but here&rsquo;s a sneak peak of the final install:</p>

We chose to simply use plastic electrical parts from the hardware store as an inexpensive option since it will not be seen. The tube that comes out is flexible and the cable is coaxed up the center divider of our closet by means of Command Strip cable clips like <a href="https://amzn.to/3NqSDxi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">these</a>.

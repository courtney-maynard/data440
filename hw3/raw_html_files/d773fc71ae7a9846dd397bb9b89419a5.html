Smoke // Doomsday Profit by Doomsday Profit &amp;amp; Smoke, releases 25 October 2024

1. Doomsday Profit - No Salvation
2. Doomsday Profit - I Am Your God
3. Doomsday Profit - Void Ritual

&amp;quot;The new Smoke // Doomsday Profit Split is a journey through the decaying heart of the American South, where the unbearable weight of history hangs heavy, and the air is thick with superstition. Both bands’ deep understanding of Southern Gothic tradition, mastery of doom metal’s crushing weight, and heavy psychedelia’s mind-expanding potential make this split a unique offering for your Halloween rituals. Wade into the darkness with this new album, knowing full well that there may be no return.&amp;quot; —BLARE

Both bands’ deep understanding of Southern Gothic tradition, mastery of doom metal’s crushing weight, and heavy psychedelia’s mind-expanding potential make this split a unique offering for your Halloween rituals. Wade into the darkness with this new album, knowing full well that there may be no return.\&quot; —BLARE&quot;,&quot;credits&quot;:&quot;DOOMSDAY PROFIT\r\nKevin See (lead guitar, vocals)\r\nRyan Sweeney (bass, vocals)\r\nBryan Reed (rhythm guitar, vocals)\r\nTradd Yancey (drums, percussion)\r\n\r\nAll tracks recorded and mixed by Scotty Sandwich at The Sandwich Shoppe.

        I received the vinyl of this amazing split unexpectedly yesterday (10/12/24) from Doomsday Profit. I&#39;ve been a fan since I 1st saw them live 2 years ago. Next month (11/14/24), I&#39;ll be seeing them a 4th time. Love these dudes. Smoke is awesome, too. All 6 tracks on this split are 🔥🔥🔥 Maybe I&#39;ll be able to catch a gig from Smoke one day

            <div class="tralbumData tralbum-about">&quot;The new Smoke // Doomsday Profit Split is a journey through the decaying heart of the American South, where the unbearable weight of history hangs heavy, and the air is thick with superstition. Both bands’ deep understanding of Southern Gothic tradition, mastery of doom metal’s crushing weight, and heavy psychedelia’s mind-expanding potential make this split a unique offering for your Halloween rituals. Wade into the darkness with this new album, knowing full well that there may be no return.&quot; —BLARE</div>

But I gotta warn you, Auralayer&#39;s Thousand Petals is probably going to duke it out for Album of the Year at Clean and Sober Stoner, maybe even the Doom Charts, against the likes of Hail the Void, Faery Ring, Snakemother and Acid King. Once you cross that line, it can be hard to go back...

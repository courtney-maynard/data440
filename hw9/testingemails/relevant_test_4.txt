Dear students, 

The W&M Mobile app provides essential information anywhere, anytime on your mobile device. The app is a joint effort between Information Technology and University Communications, and we are constantly looking for ways to improve the app and make it more user-friendly and relevant for our community. 
We would like your feedback on features we are considering adding to the app.  
The survey allows you to rank features according to your level of interest and provide additional suggestions. 
Your feedback will help us gauge interest and prioritize the development of new features.  
Please complete this 5-minute survey by April 23, 2024: https://www.wm.edu/app/survey 
We appreciate your participation and input in this process. If you have any questions please feel free to contact us at creative@wm.edu. 

Thank you for your time and feedback. 

Sincerely, 

W&M Information Technology

Dear Students,

 

This Saturday, April 13, our beautiful campus will be bustling with activity as we welcome the Class of 2028 on our annual Day for Admitted Students. Thousands of admitted students and their families from across the U.S. and globe will be here to immerse themselves in all the extraordinary experiences and opportunities William & Mary has to offer. 

 

To exemplify our core value of belonging, I encourage you to join me in welcoming our newest class and their families with warmth and enthusiasm over the weekend. The experience we provide for visitors leaves a lasting impression of our campus and our community.

 

The Sunken Garden, in particular, will be a sea of activity, featuring an abundance of performances, department chats and a diverse array of student clubs and organizations eager to showcase all that they are doing in Williamsburg and beyond. 

 

Our staff and faculty will also be featuring their research, providing engaging overviews of their teachings and expertise, as well as lifting the curtain on what it is like to be in their classes. 

 

During this time, you will likely recall the feelings you had when you first visited our beloved campus and the wonderful and welcoming community within it. This will be a special day for all our admitted students, and we hope they leave the weekend feeling as enthusiastic as we are about William & Mary. 

 

Warmly,

 

Ginger

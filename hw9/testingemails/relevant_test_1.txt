Dear William & Mary Students,

I have been following events as they have unfolded on campuses across the country this week. I imagine many of you have been, too. This time in our history can be challenging for some and unmooring for others. These events have also raised a lot of questions. 

As we head into this last week before finals, I thought it might be helpful to highlight policies and resources here that relate to the kind of activities happening elsewhere. Staff in Student Unions & Engagement, Community Values & Restorative Practices, and the Dean of Students Office are available for any questions you have.


Scheduling Office (to reserve space through the last day of classes)
Use of Campus Facilities Policy 
Non-Traditional Displays (which would include tents)
Chalking and Posting Policy (fliers, banners and chalking
 


Freedom of expression and belief are basic rights at W&M. With those rights come responsibilities including respecting the rights of one another and living within our university policies. Our mission at W&M is teaching, learning and research. We must all work together to further that mission and to affirm our core values â€” especially belonging and respect.

Sincerely,
Ginger Ambler

## Questions
### Q1: Create Two Datasets, Testing and Training
Choose a topic to classify your emails on, but only choose one topic. 
- The training dataset should consist of 20 text documents of email messages that are relevant to the topic and 20 text documents of email messages that are non-relevant to the topic.
- The testing dataset should consist of five relevant and five non-relevant text documents of email messages.

**A: What topic did you decide to classify on?**

### Q2: Naive Bayes Classifier
Use the example code to train and test your Naive Bayes classifier, using your email document dataset.
- Create a table to report the classification results for the email messages in the Testing dataset, including what the classifier reported vs the actual classification
#### Code:
```
python
```

#### Commentary:

Commentary goes here

**A: For those emails that the classifier got wrong, what factors might have caused the classifier to be incorrect? Look at the text of the email to determine.**


### Q3: Confusion Matrix
Draw a confusion matrix for the classification results, created using a table in Markdown not using another program or a screenshot of an image

**A: Based on the results in the confusion matrix, how well did the classifier perform?**

**B: Would you prefer an email classifier to have more false positives or more false negatives? Why?**

### Extra Credit Q4
Report the precision and recall scores of your classification results and include the formulas used to compute the values.

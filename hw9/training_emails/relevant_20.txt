Dear staff, faculty, and students,
I am delighted to share that Michael J. Todd, vice president for finance & administration at Lehigh University, has been selected as William & Mary’s Executive Vice President for Finance & Administration. As our chief financial and administrative officer, he will oversee the university’s core business functions and work closely with W&M leadership to implement our long-term goals.

Mr. Todd brings extensive higher education leadership experience in finance, administrative services, and research operations. His achievements include organizational and administrative transformation and innovative research partnerships. At every stage of the search process, Mr. Todd demonstrated an unwavering commitment to our mission of teaching, learning, and research. I invite you to read more about him in W&M’s news release. I look forward to welcoming Mr. Todd to W&M on August 1.

Please join me in warmly thanking the search committee, led by Provost Peggy Agouris and Senior Vice President Matthew Lambert, for their thoughtful approach to this important search. They refined the role to meet W&M’s needs and recruited a compelling national pool of candidates. They have brought us an experienced leader and a wonderful colleague.

Let me also take this moment to acknowledge the sterling work of Chief Information Officer Ed Aractingi, Associate Vice President for Business Affairs Sean Hughes, Chief Human Resources Officer Tawanda Johnson, Associate Vice President for Budget & Financial Planning Jacob Long, and Chief Financial Officer and University Controller Melanie O’Dell, who for the past 18 months have maintained important leadership functions beyond their own roles, as we searched for the right EVP. The chance to work closely with them in these capacities has been a delight for me, and shown me just how much depth of talent we have in these crucial arenas at William & Mary.

Best regards,

– Katherine

Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff,

 

Greetings as this fall semester winds down!  I hope you will find a welcome break from studying and exams by attending our annual Yule Log Ceremony – tomorrow evening, Saturday, December 14 at 5:30 p.m. in the Wren Courtyard. 

 

Sponsored annually by student members of Omicron Delta Kappa and Mortar Board leadership honor societies, this distinctly W&M event is celebrating its 90th anniversary this year! Our tradition is to gather as a community in the Wren Courtyard, where festive cressets (wood-burning torches) warm the crowd. All in attendance are treated to live choral and instrumental music, as well as reflections on the ceremony's theme – Peace, Joy, and Gratitude. You can expect a newly updated rendition of the poem, 'Twas the Night After Finals,' and President Rowe will also add her own special touches with story and song. After the formal program, all are invited into the Great Hall to toss ceremonial sprigs of holly into the Yule log fire for good luck. Then it’s hot cider and cookies for everybody. I hope you will be there!

 

Wishing you all the best as we head into the winter break.  May you enjoy rest, rejuvenation, and extra time for activities that bring you joy.

 

Ginger Ambler

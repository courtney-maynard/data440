+ A Little More Live from Vevo Studios


we're ten days into the ‘Water the Flowers, Pray for a Garden Tour’ and it's been so special to sing these songs with you each night. these are memories we'll never forget.



we'd love to see your memories from the show. you can upload a photo, video or note as a seed on our digital garden or just explore other memories from valpals around the world :')



ps. we've been handing out film cameras to our friends in the front row each night (thanks Fujifilm!). check back on the digital garden soon for a gallery of film photos from each show—captured by you!

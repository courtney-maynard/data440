Hi Courtney,

This week, we’re celebrating CSEdWeek–a week dedicated to inspiring students of all ages to explore computer science! 

CSEdWeek is all about sparking curiosity, promoting equity in tech, and celebrating the amazing work of students, educators, and partners in the field. This year’s theme, "Looking Back, Leaping Forward," reminds us how far we’ve come and challenges us to dream boldly for the future.

In honor of this special week, we're thrilled to launch the first-ever volume of our Emerging Tech Zine! 🎉 This awesome resource is exclusively available in the 3rd-5th grade Clubs curriculum on Girls Who Code HQ. Created for young learners ages 8 to 11, the zine is packed with fun stories, real-world tech examples, and hands-on activities to spark curiosity. While this edition is only for Clubs, we’ve got a special sneak peek for you below!

Inside the Zine: A Sneak Peek 👀




Clubs can access the full zine on Girls Who Code HQ! ✨


💙 Help Us Reach 5 Million: At Girls Who Code, we are on a mission to change the face of tech. In the last decade, we have reached over 670,000 people through our innovative programs and initiatives.

STELLAR ACHIEVEMENTS ✨— Makenna Kuzyk has always dreamed of becoming an astronaut– and she's well on her way to making that dream a reality. As the 10th recipient of the Order of the White Rose, a prestigious scholarship awarded to a Canadian female engineering student, Makenna will pursue a master's in flight test engineering. With her sights set on leading Canada’s space research, she’s inspiring others to reach for the stars!


WORDS OF WISDOM FROM AN AI LEADER 💡 — Grace Yee, Adobe's Senior Director of Ethical Innovation, says her secret to success is curiosity, mentorship, and staying true to her values. Her advice for young women in tech? "Advocate for yourself and prioritize yourself. You're the only one who knows how you feel and what you need." Grace’s story is a powerful reminder that with determination and support, women can thrive and lead in the rapidly evolving world of AI and STEM. 


MENTORSHIP IN STEM 🌱 — Jayshree Seth is an inventor with over 80 patents and a champion for diversity in STEM. Through the Jayshree Seth Scholarship, she’s helping women of color pursue careers in science and engineering. Her work is opening doors for future STEM leaders and showing how mentorship drives innovation.

Dear staff, faculty, and students,

I am pleased to announce that nominations for the Fall 2024 Values in Action Awards are open. These awards are among William & Mary’s most cherished recognitions.  

Awards are given each semester to employees who exemplify our shared values. Each award is accompanied by a $2,500 cash prize, and awardees are honored at Commencement. Submissions are due no later than 5 p.m., Wednesday, October 16.

How to submit a nomination:

Nominations will be submitted using the online submission form.
All non-student employees of W&M or contractors providing auxiliary services to the university are eligible for nomination.
An individual may submit one nomination. Individuals may nominate another individual, or they may self-nominate.

Thank you for helping us celebrate our talented colleagues.

Best regards,

– Katherine

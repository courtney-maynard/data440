Dear Students,

 

I wanted to reach out as communities across our region continue to respond to Hurricane Helene’s devastating impacts. Know that we are here to offer support and guidance for anyone whose family is affected by the storm’s aftermath.

 

If you or your family has been impacted – or you know of someone at William & Mary who may need support – please reach out to Care Support Services by emailing care@wm.edu, calling 757-221-1236, or submitting a Care Concern.

 

Please contact us if we can help in any way.  

 

Yours,

Dear faculty, staff, and students,

I write to share news that Vice President for Strategy & Innovation Jeremy Martin Ph.D. ’12, M.B.A. ’17 will become the 18th president of Florida Southern College in August. Ethical and mission-driven, Dr. Martin is the type of leader higher education needs to meet this moment of rapid transformation.

Over nearly two decades, Dr. Martin has earned this community’s trust and deep respect. He joined the university full-time in 2012 after receiving his doctorate from the School of Education. In 2019, he became Chief of Staff, and in 2022, William & Mary named him Vice President for Strategy & Innovation.

W&M is a stronger, more strategic, and more welcoming university thanks to Dr. Martin. He co-chaired the strategic planning committee to create Vision 2026. As interim director of athletics, he mapped a path forward for Athletics at a time of transition, shaped our All In fundraising campaign, and helped recruit a phenomenal AD. He launched innovative programs that have significantly increased accessibility and affordability for Pell-grant eligible students and strengthened enrollment.

Dr. Martin will continue at W&M until mid-July. In the coming days, I will work with the leadership in Undergraduate Admission, University Communications, and University Marketing to develop short- and long-term organizational plans.

We will have an opportunity to celebrate Dr. Martin together, on Monday, July 15, at 4 p.m. in the Wren Great Hall. Until then, please join me in congratulating him and extending best wishes to his family as they prepare for this new chapter.

Sincerely,

– Katherine

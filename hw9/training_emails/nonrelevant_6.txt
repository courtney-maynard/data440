Dear Courtney,

All of us at the Duke Graduate School are committed to helping make your education as affordable as possible. To that end, we’d like to share some tips on finding funding for your studies.

Costs of attending Duke and financial awards available vary based on whether you are interested in applying for a Master’s or Ph.D. program. To see a breakdown of costs for both domestic and international students including tuition, fees, and estimates for extraneous expenses, we encourage you to review our costs webpage.

The Graduate School also offers other resources to help meet your financial needs, such as child-care subsidies, grants to help with medical expenses or financial hardship, and short-term loans for temporary situations.

In addition to awards available through the university, students are urged to compete for national and foundation awards, which are prestigious and valuable acknowledgement of our students’ intellectual promise. Our funding database is a great place to start exploring both Duke and external sources of financial support.

For more information on Duke's funding resources, review our financial support webpages or reach out to us online.

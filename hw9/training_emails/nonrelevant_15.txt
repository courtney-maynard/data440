       Frequently Asked Questions 
       
       Why am I receiving this email? 
       There hasn’t been a purchase from this account in
       over 18 months. Our photo storage policy requires
       an order—even if it’s small. You can order any
       items we sell at Shutterfly. As long as you do it
       once every 18 months, you’re good!  
 
       What do I have to do? 
       Based on your purchase activity, you must place
       an order soon. 
 
       What happens if I don’t place an order? 
       If you do not wish to place an order, the photos
       and albums in your Shutterfly account will
       be moved to our reserve servers. This means you will
       not be able to download or share your photos until
       you make a purchase. You will still have access to
       your Shutterfly account and can create new
       projects or make a purchase at any time. 
 
      Where can I find more information about the
      photo storage policy?
      We’re glad you asked! You can learn more at
      shutterfly.com/photo-storage.

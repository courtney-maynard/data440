Hi there,

Did you know that the biggest drop off of girls in computer science occurs before they turn 20? At Girls Who Code, we know that sometimes you can’t be what you can’t see.


That’s why we teamed up with Clé de Peau Beauté to create our 20 under 20, shining a light on 20 young women who are changing the face of STEM.


Our grand prize winners received a trip to New York City to tour the Shiseido Americas Innovation Center with a keynote from our founder Reshma Saujani, exclusive access to Clé de Peau Beauté’s labs, meetups with top scientists, and grants to support their projects.

Congratulations to our grand prize finalists Reeva Khokhar, Neha Shukla, and Tanya Shah.
 


Reeva Khokhar is currently studying finance and computer science with a concentration in AI at Rutgers University. During the pandemic, she developed an app to help kids with special needs adapt to virtual learning. Now she is exploring how AI can help make healthcare services more equitable and accessible. As the National Executive Director of Girl Genius, Reeva is on a mission to help educate and inspire other girls to change the face of STEM. Reeva also organizes coding hackathons and  is recognized on Major League Hacking’s Top 50 Hackers list.


Neha Shukla is a computer science major at Duke University with a concentration in AI and machine learning. She currently leads the World Economic Forum’s Generation AI Youth Council on ethical child-safe AI policy. Neha has also published two best-selling books: Innovation for Everyone and A Kids Book About AI. She hopes to become an AI research scientist and develop algorithms that reduce racial and gender inequality.


High school student Tanya Shah is the Co-Founder of the nonprofit UpliftIndiaGlobal. Tanya plans on pursuing biotechnology in college and starting a biotech company that specializes in healthcare. She loves skiing and coding and volunteers at her local nonprofit that teaches Gujarati, her native language.

GAMECHANGERS 🎮—  “Why don’t any of my game characters have Afro hair like mine?”

When Yvonne’s six-year-old daughter asked this, the duo was inspired to create the games they wanted to see in the world. This led them to develop Frobelles, a game featuring characters with natural Afro-kinky hair textures, allowing young girls with curly and coily hair to see themselves represented. 


“IN THE CLERB, WE ALL FAM” 🕺🪩— Talk about sisterhood! ✨ At Girls Who Code, we do more than simply teach our students how to code; we also help them build a community with other technologists and lifelong friendships. Follow us on TikTok and check out our latest video of the week.


TECH FOR GOOD 💜—After being exploited during her relocation, Jane Fisher turned to tech to better advocate for the rights of immigrants. This inspired her to create Imii, an app that helps immigrants navigate challenges like finding reliable information on housing and access to healthcare and banking services.

Dear William & Mary Students,
 
On behalf of my fellow members of City Council and our residents, I want to thank you for choosing Williamsburg and William & Mary as your home. We are so grateful to have the energy and excitement that you bring to our community.
 
So many of the fundamental concepts of our nation were nurtured right here in Williamsburg. The values of public service, of continued learning, of liberty and equality have deep roots here. Williamsburg may be small, but it has so much to offer â€“ and we want you to be involved. Students serve on our boards and commissions, they volunteer with local organizations, they intern in City offices, and they even attend City Council meetings. Take advantage of living and learning in a small town built on big ideas. 
 
We also want your input. The City of Williamsburg will soon host Future Festivals, an interactive public input process that asks residents to help us shape our two-year strategic plan. Attendees play games specifically designed to gather their input. The City will host seven Future Festivals at seven different locations around the City between Sept. 10 and Sept. 19. One of those stops is Crim Dell Meadow right on the William & Mary campus from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Friday, Sept. 13.
 
Another way to see all that Williamsburg has to offer is to participate in the 10th annual Great Williamsburg Adventure Race, which is free for William & Mary students. The race, slated for Saturday, Sept. 28, will have you racing around town to complete challenges, decode puzzles, and solve riddles.

Have a great year and Go Tribe! 
 
Cordially,


Mayor Douglas G. Pons

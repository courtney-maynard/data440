Dear William & Mary Community,

 

As President Rowe noted in her message this morning, a cherished W&M tradition is our gathering each August at Opening Convocation to formally celebrate the start of the academic session. Most especially it is a time of joyful welcome for our newest students. Opening Convocation will take place this evening at 7:15 p.m. in the Wren Yard. All new 2024 – spring and fall – graduate and undergraduate students, as well as our W&M St Andrews Joint Degree Programme students and student athletes who may have missed their own Convocation in previous years are our guests of honor and will be ushered to reserved seating for the occasion. 

 

Celebrated cardiologist and barrier-breaking musician Cleve Francis M.A. ’69 will deliver the Convocation address.

 

Following the official procession of all 2024 new students through the portico of the Wren Building, the entire campus community is invited to share in Sunken Garden festivities. All are welcome. The weather today is warm and sunny -- perfect for gathering as a community at the Wren Building to begin a new academic year.

 

See you later today as we celebrate the arrival of new students to our One Tribe, One Family!

 

Ginger Ambler

Chair, Opening Convocation

Dear Students,

 

Parking & Transportation Services announced necessary adjustments to the Boswell and PBK parking lots as the Muscarelle renovation draws to a close. This adjustment will impact all students, faculty and staff, including those with limited mobility. The work is scheduled to begin Monday Oct 21st and is expected to last approximately four (4) weeks. Contractors will be moving portions of the existing project fence line to allow for the restoration of the sidewalks and front approach to the building as well as general circulation around the area. The fire lane between the museum and PBK will be closed, and the current ADA pathways will be adjusted. For more information, please see the Parking Advisory announcement.

 

Sincerely,

 

Student Affairs

Dear Students,

 

Duke University has just announced that Stacey Harris, currently dean of students at William & Mary, will be joining its team as an Associate Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students, starting July 15.

 

Dean Harris came to William & Mary two summers ago from Boston University. Since joining Student Affairs, she has engaged broadly and deeply with life at the university. As Dean of Students, she provided leadership to the Student Success thematic area, which houses Academic Wellbeing, Care Support Services, the Center for Student Diversity, Conflict Resolution & Peer Mediation, Community Values & Restorative Practices, Parent & Family Programs, the Haven, and Student Accessibility Services.

 

Dean Harris has been a strong advocate for W&M students. She made herself available to students both in and out of the office, at events, performances, and games. Working closely with individual students as well as with groups, she devoted considerable time to helping students navigate through challenging circumstances.

 

I’ll be meeting with Student Affairs and Dean of Students leadership teams in the coming days to discuss future plans and preparations for the 2024-25 academic year. Dean Harris’ last day at William & Mary will be June 30. Please join me in congratulating her on this new appointment.

 

Warmly,

Ginger Ambler

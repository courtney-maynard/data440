Hey there Courtney!



I recently took a course on science leadership. We shared stories about student supervision and one of the professors complained that there are always students in her group who claim they simply can not write.



And the truth is: because they believe they can not write, they actually can not write.



In reality, writing is simply a skill. It is just like any other skill we have to acquire as scientists.



But the self-fulfilling prophecy can really make scientists get stuck in a writing rut. I have certainly been there.


So at the very beginning of my online course “Paper Writing Masterclass”, I bust the four most persistent myths about writing research papers.


Chances are, you have had doubts about your writing abilities as well. Check out if the myth buster will help you write research papers more efficiently.



This is a free lesson in my online course. Watch the myth buster here.

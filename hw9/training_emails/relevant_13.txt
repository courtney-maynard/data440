Dear Students, Faculty & Staff,
 
This evening at Convocation, we will open William & Mary’s 332nd academic year and cheer our new students through the Wren Building. Campus is already buzzing with returners moving in. Please join us, to help amp up the festivities and noise.
 
W&M staff and faculty have been busy too, preparing with excitement for the year ahead. We have been especially intentional in leaning into our shared values as the anchor of this vibrant learning community. Among the highlights of the summer: more than 70% of our faculty and staff gathered to explore Better Arguments at W&M — the same framework for civic engagement that new students learn during orientation. We took time for sharing and reflection, appreciating the grace we offer each other at W&M as we explore differing views. Please stay tuned for more information on opportunities to practice — coming from our Student Assembly and the Professional Development Committee.
 
Tonight, “You belong” will ring out strong and true and clear. Convocation joyfully affirms the deep personal connections that are hallmarks of this university. 
 
See you at the Wren!
 
– Katherine

Dear students, 

As the semester winds down, I want to take a moment to remind you about the "Thank-a-Teacher" program. If you've had an instructor, TA or tutor who has made a meaningful impact on your learning this semester, consider letting them know how much their hard work and dedication are appreciated. 

Your kind words will be shared with them as a heartfelt token of gratitude and recognition. 

You can submit your thank-you message here: https://forms.office.com/r/LvtBmuFC1m 

I encourage you to share your message this week as the semester comes to a close, but the form will remain open for a short time if you'd like to reflect and submit later. 

On behalf of the entire A&S leadership team, I wish you the very best as you finish your final exams and prepare for a well-deserved holiday break. Take care of yourselves, and know how proud we are of all your efforts this semester. 

Warm regards, 

Suzanne Raitt

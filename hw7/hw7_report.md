## Q1 
Find three users who are closest to me in terms of age, gender, and occupation.
For each of those 3 users:

- **a: what are their top 3 (favorite) films?**
  
- **b: what are their bottom 3 (least favorite) films**

Based on the movie values in those 6 tables, choose a user that is most like me, the *substitute me*. 

## Q2
Based on the raings that users have given to the movies, answer the following questions:

- **a: which five users are most correlated to the *substitute me*? (i.e. which 5 users rate movies most similarly to the substitute me?)**
- **b: which five users are least correlated (i.e. negative correlation)**

## Q3
Computing ratings for all the films that the *substitute me* has not seen.

- **provide a list of the top five recommendations for films that the *substitute me* should see**
- **provide a list of the bottom five recommendations (i.e. films the *substitute me* will likely hate**

## Q4
Choose my favorite and least favorite films from the list.
- **for each film, generate a list of the top five most correlated and bottom five least correlated films (20 in total)**
- *Q: Based on your knowledge of the resulting films, do I agree with the results? Do I personally like/dislike the resulting films?*
